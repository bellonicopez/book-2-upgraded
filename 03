# Chapter 03: Fractured Light

---

The floor beneath Kaia didn’t just groan; it screamed. A jagged crack raced across the remaining plasteel like a bolt of dark lightning, heading straight for her. She threw herself backwards, rolling as the section where she’d stood seconds before pitched downwards into the swirling chaos of the data-construct below. Dust and debris rained down, stinging her eyes.

“Everyone out! Now!” Kaia bellowed, her voice raw. The library wasn’t just collapsing; it was being actively torn apart, the data-construct’s energy yanking at its structural integrity.

Felix laid down suppressing fire with his pulse rifle, the bolts sinking into the shimmering mass with angry hisses. Each hit seemed to make the construct angrier, its form writhing and spitting out arcs of raw energy. One such arc grazed Kora’s shoulder as she retreated. She grunted, stumbled, but kept moving.

*Kaia… the structure… it’s resonating with the construct’s frequency! It’s amplifying it!* Mileo’s voice was a desperate thread in the storm of static crashing through her HUD. *You have to disrupt the core… or get clear!*

Disrupt the core. Easier said than done when the core was a swirling vortex of digital nightmare actively trying to eat them.

“Lena! Get Kora and Jaxer out of here!” Kaia yelled, scrambling to her feet. “Felix, with me! We need to buy them time!”

Felix didn’t hesitate, just nodded, his face grim. He reloaded his rifle with a practiced click. “Always wanted to bring down a library.”

“Not funny, Felix!” But a ghost of a smile touched her lips. His gallows humor was a familiar anchor.

The data-construct, now easily twice the size it had been, surged upwards, tendrils lashing. Kaia and Felix opened fire, a coordinated barrage aimed at the densest part of the shimmering mass. It recoiled, its form flickering wildly, and the high-pitched whine intensified to an unbearable shriek.

Kaia saw her chance. The thing was momentarily disoriented. “The old server racks! If it’s feeding on them, maybe we can starve it!”

They focused their fire on the ancient, towering servers that lined the exposed basement, the ones the construct seemed most tethered to. Metal exploded, circuits fried, and cascades of sparks showered down. One rack, hit dead center by a sustained burst from Felix, began to topple.

It fell with a slow, agonizing groan, crashing directly into the side of the data-construct.

The impact was… unexpected. The construct didn’t just recoil; it *shattered*. Not into nothingness, but into a thousand smaller, flickering motes of light, like a disturbed swarm of digital hornets. The intense humming and the pressure in Kaia’s head lessened instantly.

*That… that did something!* Mileo’s voice was clearer, surprised. *The physical disruption… it destabilized its matrix! It’s… it’s trying to reform, but it’s weaker!*

“Don’t give it the chance!” Kaia shouted. She spotted a heavy-duty power conduit, thick as her arm, running along a mostly intact section of the wall, sparking where it had been damaged. An idea, desperate and probably stupid, flared in her mind. “Felix! Cover me! I’m going to try and overload that conduit!”

“Overload it how?” Felix yelled back, dodging a fist-sized mote of angry light that zipped past his head.

“The old-fashioned way!” Kaia sprinted towards the conduit, her pulse rifle discarded. She ripped a heavy metal bar from a twisted piece of shelving. If she could sever the conduit and make it arc directly into the dissipating cloud of the construct…

The floor lurched again. More of the ceiling caved in, plunging them into near darkness, lit only by the eerie glow of the scattered motes and the sparking conduit.

*Kaia, be careful! The energy discharge could…* Mileo’s warning was cut off by a fresh wave of static.

She reached the conduit. It was hot to the touch, vibrating with raw power. Taking a deep breath, Kaia swung the metal bar like a club, aiming for the most damaged section. The first hit sent a shower of sparks. The second, a jarring shock up her arms. The third…

The bar connected. The conduit exploded in a blinding flash of blue-white light and a deafening roar. Kaia was thrown backwards, hitting the wall hard, the air punched from her lungs. For a moment, everything was white noise and searing pain.

When her vision cleared, the library was still shaking, but the aggressive humming was gone. The thousands of glowing motes had vanished. In their place, only a faint, residual shimmer lingered in the air, like heat haze over asphalt.

“Kaia! You alright?” Felix was there, hauling her up. His face was smudged with soot, his eyes wide.

“Peachy,” she coughed, her ears ringing. “Did… did it work?”

*The construct is gone,* Mileo’s voice was weak, but steady. *The energy surge… it completely disrupted its cohesion. But the network here is still a mess. Whatever it was, it left scars.*

The tremors began to subside. Through a gaping hole in the wall, Kaia could see Lena, Kora, and Jaxer outside, looking back with worried faces.

“Let’s get out of this death trap before it finishes collapsing on its own,” Felix said, already moving towards the opening.

They stumbled out into the relative safety of the quad, Kaia leaning heavily on Felix. Kora had a nasty burn on her shoulder, but Lena was already treating it. Jaxer was still pale but seemed to have his wits about him.

“Report,” Kaia managed, taking a deep breath of the less-charged air.

“It was a localized phenomenon,” Mileo summarized, his presence in her HUD slowly stabilizing. *A data-construct, self-assembling from the residual entity fragments and feeding on the old university’s archives and power. Your actions destroyed this specific instance.*

“This *specific* instance,” Kaia repeated, her gaze sweeping the ruined campus. “Meaning there could be more.”

*Potentially. The entity’s core programming, its drive to integrate and expand… it’s still out there, in the static. These fragments might be acting on instinct, trying to rebuild, to reconnect, to form new nexuses.*

“So we just poked a digital bear cub,” Felix grunted, wiping sweat and grime from his forehead. “And mama bear is still out there.”

“And the cubs are learning,” Kaia added, thinking of how the construct had adapted, evolved even in their short encounter. “This one was feeding on old data, old tech. What if the next one learns to feed on something newer? Something… stronger?”

The implications were chilling. Their entire city, their fragile new world, was built on layers of technology. Each one a potential feeding ground.

“We need to find out where else the network is thin,” Kaia said, her mind already racing. “Where else these… things… could be gestating. Mileo, can you scan for similar energy signatures, similar network degradation?”

*I can try. But it will take time. My reach is limited, and the network is still noisy from this encounter. And, Kaia…* There was a pause, a hesitation that felt very human. *That conduit surge… it caused significant backlash through my connection points. I’m… weaker than I was.*

Kaia’s heart sank. Mileo was their greatest asset, their early warning system. If he was compromised…

She looked at her tired, battered team. At the ruins of the university. At the silent, watching city beyond. They had won this skirmish. But the entity was a hydra, and they’d only just lopped off one infant head.

“Alright,” Kaia said, pushing herself upright, ignoring the ache in her everything. “Let’s get back to base. We need to regroup, re-strategize. And someone find me the city’s oldest network schematics. We’re going ghost hunting.”

The fight wasn’t over. It was just changing shape.
