# Chapter 14: The Blood-Red Thread

---

Days bled into a grim routine at the enclave. Patrols were doubled, sentries jumpier than ever. Every flicker of a light, every unexplained sound, was scrutinized. The knowledge of Serenity General and its ancient, hostile guardian had cast a long, cold shadow, making the ever-present threat of the entity feel almost mundane by comparison – a familiar monster, at least.

Lena’s arm was healing, the burn a livid reminder of the Warden’s power. Kora, now fully recovered from her own encounter with the entity’s corrupting touch, assisted her in the makeshift med-bay, the two of them poring over the data gleaned from Kora’s initial wound and the fragmented bio-scans from Serenity’s pathology lab.

Ryn, meanwhile, was a man possessed, hunched over his consoles, cross-referencing the city’s decaying data archives with Mileo’s limited input from Serenity General. He was searching for any mention of Project Chimera, any clue to the "cycle" the Warden had spoken of, but the Old World had buried its secrets deep.

Mileo’s terminal remained mostly dark. His presence in Kaia’s HUD was a weak, intermittent pulse, his usual stream of data reduced to hesitant trickles. The encounter with the Warden’s defenses had clearly taken a toll. Kaia visited the terminal often, a silent vigil.

“Anything?” she asked one evening, finding Ryn still at his post, his face illuminated by the ghostly glow of holographic schematics.

Ryn sighed, pushing a stray lock of hair from his eyes. “It’s like chasing phantoms. Project Chimera is a ghost in the machine. Heavy redactions everywhere. Cross-references lead to dead ends or more classified files. Whatever it was, they *really* didn’t want anyone knowing about it. The only recurring term I find associated with its vague outlines is ‘Subject Zero’.”

“Subject Zero?” Kaia frowned. “The first experiment? The source?”

“Possibly. Or the desired outcome. There’s no context.” Ryn leaned back, rubbing his tired eyes. “But Lena and Kora might have something on the entity’s side of things. They’ve been comparing the genetic markers from Kora’s wound with the data the entity was trying to absorb at Serenity.”

Kaia found Lena and Kora in the med-bay, a complex holographic display of intertwined genetic sequences hovering between them.
“We think we found a pattern,” Lena said, her voice tight with a mixture of excitement and apprehension. “The entity, when it assimilated Jaxer, it wasn’t just taking over his body. It was *learning* from his biology. Rapidly. But Kora’s encounter was different.”

Kora nodded. “The corruption in my wound… it wasn’t trying to assimilate me directly, not like Jaxer. It was… sampling. Testing. Looking for specific genetic markers. Compatibility.”

“And those markers,” Lena continued, pointing to highlighted segments in the holographic display, “we found traces of similar search patterns in the data fragments Mileo retrieved from the Serenity pathology lab. The entity was looking for something specific in that old genetic material too.”

“What specific markers?” Kaia asked, her gaze fixed on the glowing helix.

“It’s complex,” Lena admitted. “But there’s a recurring theme. It seems to be searching for individuals with a high degree of… genetic plasticity. Adaptability. Markers often associated with rapid cellular regeneration, unusual immune responses… even some that, in the Old World’s databases, were flagged as ‘anomalous’ or ‘potentially problematic’.”

“Problematic how?”

“Prone to mutation. Unstable under certain environmental stressors,” Kora supplied. “The kind of genetic traits the Old World was obsessed with either ‘fixing’ or… exploiting.”

A cold dread began to creep up Kaia’s spine. “Exploiting… like in Project Chimera?”

Lena and Kora exchanged a look. “That’s the disturbing part,” Lena said. “Some of the ‘anomalous’ markers the entity is searching for? We found similar, though much more heavily manipulated and hybridized, sequences in the corrupted data from Serenity General’s deeper archives – the ones Ryn managed to partially decrypt, the ones that hinted at the nature of Project Chimera’s… subjects.”

A blood-red thread was beginning to emerge, connecting the entity’s current activities with the Old World’s forgotten sins.

“So, the entity isn’t just looking for hosts,” Kaia pieced it together slowly. “It’s looking for *specific kinds* of hosts. People with… a certain genetic makeup. And that makeup has echoes in whatever monstrous experiments were happening in Serenity General.”

Just then, Mileo’s terminal across the main chamber flickered. Not with the usual weak pulse, but with a steady, albeit dim, light. A moment later, his synthesized voice, weak but clearer than it had been in days, came over the enclave’s comms.

*“Kaia… Ryn… I have cross-referenced Lena’s findings with the residual data fragments from the Warden’s network and the entity’s upload signature from Relay 7.”*

Everyone in the main chamber froze. Kaia hurried towards the terminal.
*“The entity is not just searching for compatible hosts. It is searching for a specific genetic lineage. A bloodline. One that possesses a unique combination of these ‘anomalous’ markers. A lineage that, according to the Warden’s fragmented archives, was instrumental to the initial phases of Project Chimera.”*

“A bloodline?” Ryn breathed, rushing to Mileo’s side. “Instrumental how?”

*“The data suggests this lineage was… resistant to early crystalline augmentation attempts. Able to integrate, rather than be consumed or rejected. They were… the key to stabilizing the hybridization process for Subject Zero.”*

The room was silent, save for the hum of the enclave’s struggling power supply.
The entity wasn’t just evolving. It was hunting for a key. A key forged in the Old World’s most secret and terrifying laboratories. A key that could unlock a new, even more horrifying stage of its evolution, or perhaps, even allow it to interface with or control the monstrous legacy of Project Chimera itself.

And the chilling question that hung in the air, unspoken but felt by everyone, was: did that bloodline still exist? And if so, who were they? Were they living, unknown, among the scattered survivors of Neo-Citania?

The search for answers had just become a desperate race to find a ghost from the past before the entity did.
