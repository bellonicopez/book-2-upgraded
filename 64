*No transmissions from Trident assault team for 55 minutes. Last known position: approaching suspected nexus antechamber. Psychic interference levels emanating from Station Zero are spiking. The entity is fully aware and highly agitated. Nautilus maintains support position but reports extreme turbulence and aggressive mutated fauna. All enclave personnel on high alert.*

The archway left by the dissolved living membrane led into a chamber unlike any they had encountered. It was vast, circular, and disturbingly… pristine. The metallic walls gleamed under a cold, internal luminescence that seemed to emanate from intricate patterns of Cascade energy conduits embedded within them, pulsing like malevolent veins. The air was frigid, and the sickly sweet smell of corrupted energy was almost overpowering.

But it was the centerpiece of the room that seized their attention. Floating in the exact center, suspended by crackling beams of dark energy, was a colossal, multifaceted crystal. It was not a natural formation; its facets were too perfect, its angles too sharp. It pulsed with an inner light that shifted from blood red to an oily black, and from it, Kora could feel the raw, unfiltered psychic presence of Aris Thorne, magnified and terrifyingly potent.

*"So, the insects have reached my inner sanctum,"* a voice echoed, not through their comms, but directly within their minds. It was cultured, tinged with arrogance and an almost bored disdain. It was Thorne. *"I must confess, your persistence is… mildly irritating."*

“Thorne,” Kora breathed, the Resonance Keystone flaring in response to his direct psychic address. “It’s over. Your experiment failed. You’ve only brought ruin.”

A dry, mirthless chuckle resonated in their skulls. *"Failed? Child, I am on the cusp of ultimate understanding, ultimate control. This world, this very reality, is but clay for me to reshape. You see ruin; I see potential. A canvas for a new creation, with myself as its guiding intelligence."*

As he spoke, the multifaceted crystal pulsed violently. From its dark facets, shadowy, vaguely humanoid figures began to coalesce, forming into spectral, armor-clad warriors wielding weapons of solidified shadow. They were not mutated creatures; they were psychic constructs, projections of Thorne’s will, more focused and dangerous than anything they had faced.

“Psychic projections!” Felix barked, his rifle already spitting fire. “Don’t let them touch you! Aim for the crystal – it must be their source!”

The spectral warriors glided towards them, silent and unnervingly fast. Physical rounds passed through them with minimal effect, causing them to shimmer and momentarily lose cohesion, but they quickly reformed.
“They’re barely physical!” Anya yelled, dodging a shadowy blade that would have passed through her suit’s armor like smoke, yet carried a lethal psychic impact. “Kora, can you disrupt them?”

Kora, already engaged in a direct psychic battle with Thorne, whose mental voice was now a torrent of taunts and promises of power if she would only join him, struggled to divide her focus. The Keystone was working overtime, its light a brilliant shield against Thorne’s primary assault, but the sheer number of projections was overwhelming.

*"Your harmony is a childish fantasy, Kora,"* Thorne sneered in her mind. *"Dissonance is the true engine of change, of evolution! Embrace it! Feel its power!"* He tried to flood her mind with the intoxicating allure of raw Cascade energy, the sensation of godlike power he himself coveted.

“Never!” Kora cried out, her voice amplified by a surge of power from the Keystone. She unleashed a wave of harmonizing energy, not as a beam, but as an expanding sphere. The spectral warriors closest to her recoiled, their forms flickering violently. “They’re vulnerable to direct psychic disruption! Felix, buy me time!”

Felix and Jax laid down a concentrated field of fire, not trying to destroy the projections, but to keep them off balance, to disrupt their forms long enough for Anya and Kora to act. Anya, taking her cue from Kora, began to focus her own mental discipline – a rudimentary technique Kora had taught some of Felix’s team – trying to project focused intent, a ‘psychic shove,’ at the nearest assailants. It wasn’t as powerful as Kora’s song, but it made the spectral figures hesitate, their movements becoming less certain.

Kora, meanwhile, focused her entire will, amplified by the Keystone, on the giant, floating crystal. If it was the source of these projections, and a focusing lens for Thorne’s power in this antechamber, then it had to be shattered. She gathered her energy, her song building into a piercing, resonant frequency, a pure note of order aimed at the heart of the crystal’s chaotic structure.

*"Insolent gnat!"* Thorne’s mental voice shrieked, the disdain replaced by a flash of genuine fury. The psychic pressure in the room became immense, the very walls seeming to groan. The crystal pulsed erratically, unleashing bolts of dark energy that lashed out at the team. One struck Jax’s shoulder, his HEV suit sparking as its internal dampeners struggled to absorb the psychic shock, sending him staggering.

“Jax!” Anya cried, turning to cover him.

Kora ignored the chaos, her focus absolute. The note she was projecting, amplified by the Keystone, resonated with the crystalline structure. Hairline cracks of pure white light began to appear on its dark facets.

*"NO! You will not undo my work!"* Thorne roared in her mind. He abandoned his attempts to seduce her, his psychic assault becoming a raw, desperate bludgeon.

But Kora held firm, her song reaching an almost unbearable crescendo. The cracks in the crystal spread, spiderwebbing across its surface. With a final, explosive pulse from the Resonance Keystone, Kora’s note found the crystal’s resonant breaking point.

The giant crystal shattered.

It didn’t explode in a shower of physical shards, but rather imploded, collapsing in on itself in a silent flash of black light, then vanishing utterly. The spectral warriors winked out of existence. The oppressive psychic weight in the room lessened dramatically, though Thorne’s furious, pained mental shriek still echoed in their minds.

For a moment, there was silence, broken only by Jax’s pained gasps and the hum of their suit systems.
“The crystal… it’s gone,” Anya said, her voice filled with disbelief.
“That wasn’t his nexus,” Kora said, her breathing heavy, the Keystone’s light dimming slightly as she conserved her energy. “That was a focusing lens. A relay. His true core is deeper. But we hurt him. That definitely hurt him.”

As she spoke, a section of the far wall, previously seamless, began to retract with a low groan, revealing a dark, narrow passageway. A cold, intense wave of pure dissonance washed over them from the opening, far stronger than anything they had felt before.

Felix helped Jax to his feet. “Can you walk, Sergeant?”
Jax nodded, wincing. “Shoulder’s… ringing like a church bell, but the suit held. I’m good.”
“That passage,” Felix said, his gaze fixed on the new opening. “That’s where he is. That’s the real heart of Station Zero.”

*"You will regret this intrusion,"* Thorne’s voice whispered in their minds, weaker now, laced with pain, but still dripping with venom. *"You have only delayed the inevitable. Come then, Kora. Come and witness the birth of a god."*

Kora met Felix’s gaze. “He’s inviting us in. He’s wounded, but he’s waiting.”
“Then we don’t keep him waiting,” Felix said grimly. “Let’s go say hello.”
