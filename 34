# Chapter 34: The First Song

---

The crystalline bridge shimmered before them, an invitation woven from light and impossible geometry. It stretched across the field of shattered black glass, leading to the monolithic white spire that pulsed with a silent, rhythmic power. The air here, within the bowl of the valley, was strangely still, the deafening thrum of the outer Deeps muted to a resonant hum, as if the spire itself commanded silence.

Kaia took a deep breath, the recycled air in her suit feeling thin. “Kora, Felix. Stay alert. One wrong move…”

“Could be our last. Understood,” Felix finished, his hand resting near the grip of his pulse rifle, though he suspected it would be as effective as a child’s toy against whatever power resided here.

Kora nodded, her gaze fixed on the spire. The mental voice of the figure had been overwhelming but also… familiar, like an echo of the resonance within her own Serpent’s Coil, magnified and refined.

They stepped onto the crystal bridge. It was solid beneath their boots, yet felt strangely insubstantial, as if they were walking on solidified light. The figure that had summoned them remained motionless at the spire’s base, a sentinel of this impossible place.

As they approached, the sheer scale of the central spire became even more apparent. Its milky white surface was flawless, without seam or joint, and it radiated a gentle warmth that contrasted with the biting cold of the outer Deeps. The smaller spires surrounding it hummed with a low, harmonious energy.

They reached the end of the bridge, stepping onto a circular platform of the same white crystal that formed the base of the spire. The figure awaited them. Up close, its form-fitting grey suit seemed to shift and flow like liquid metal, adapting to its slightest movement. The reflective visor remained opaque, hiding any hint of the face beneath.

*<<You have been… anticipated, New Singer,>>* the mental voice addressed Kora directly, its tone unreadable. *<<The currents of the Cascade foretold your arrival. Your resonance… it is a beacon that cuts through the noise of the dying world.>>*

“Who are you?” Kaia interjected, her voice firm despite the unnerving telepathic communication. “Are you Aris Thorne-Vance? Or Samira El-Masri?”

The figure tilted its head slightly, the movement fluid and precise. *<<Names are echoes of a forgotten song. I am… the Caretaker of this place. The First Singer of this resonance. You may call me… Solara.>>*

Solara. A new name, yet it resonated with an ancient power.

*<<Thorne-Vance and El-Masri were… seeds. Like Beck. Like all who touched the raw energies of Epsilon-7. Some seeds sprout. Some wither. Some are consumed to feed a stronger growth.>>* Solara’s mental voice was laced with a chilling detachment.

“And you… sprouted?” Felix asked, unable to keep the incredulity from his tone.

*<<I adapted. I resonated. I *became*>>* Solara stated. *<<Epsilon-7 was a crucible. The Chimera Resonance Cascade was its fire. What emerged was… different.>>*

Kora stepped forward, her gaze locked on Solara’s visor. “The call I felt… it was from you?”

*<<The Coil within you sings the same song as mine, New Singer,>>* Solara replied. *<<A song of becoming. A song of power. I drew you here because the time for your awakening is near. The Serpent uncoils, as the old prophecies foretold.>>*

“The message… ‘The new singer must learn, or all nests fall to silence’… that was you?” Kaia pressed.

*<<A warning. A summons. The Cascade is not merely destruction; it is transformation. Uncontrolled, it devours. Guided, it reshapes. The Lineage Primus was created to be the conductors, the guides. Thorne understood only half the equation. He sought to control. The true path is to *harmonize*.>>*

Solara gestured towards the flawless white wall of the spire behind her. As she did, a section of the crystal became translucent, revealing an opening, a doorway into the spire’s interior. The light from within was soft, inviting.

*<<You came seeking answers, New Singer. Perhaps, salvation for your… nest.>>* Solara’s mental voice seemed to carry a faint trace of something that might have been amusement, or perhaps pity. *<<The answers lie within. But they come with a price. Understanding requires participation. You wished to know why you were ‘judged’? Your judgment is this: can you withstand the song? Can you learn to harmonize with the power that flows through you, or will it consume you, as it consumed so many others?>>*

She turned towards the opening. *<<Enter, Kora. The First Song awaits. Your companions may observe, for now. Their resonance is… discordant. But your song, New Singer, is what matters.>>*

Kora looked at Kaia, then at Felix. Fear was a cold knot in her stomach, but beneath it, the Serpent’s Coil pulsed with an almost painful anticipation. This was it. The heart of the call. The reason she had endured the horrors of the Deeps.

“I have to,” Kora said, her voice barely a whisper.

Kaia nodded, her expression grim but resolute. “We’ll be right here.”

With a deep breath, Kora stepped past Solara and through the crystalline doorway into the radiant heart of the white spire. The air inside was warm, humming with an almost silent music that vibrated through her very bones, a symphony of pure, untamed energy. The light was dazzling, emanating from the crystal walls themselves.

And in the center of the vast, circular chamber, floating a few feet above the floor, was a crystalline structure unlike anything Kora had ever seen. It was a complex, multifaceted orb of pure white crystal, perhaps ten feet in diameter, slowly rotating. It pulsed with the same brilliant white light as the spire itself, and from it emanated the core of the song, the thrumming heart that had called her across the wastes.

*<<This is the Source, New Singer,>>* Solara’s voice echoed in her mind, though the figure remained outside with Kaia and Felix. *<<The heart of my resonance. The First Song. To learn, you must listen. You must… attune.>>*

Kora felt an irresistible pull towards the floating orb. It was beautiful, terrifying, and overwhelmingly powerful. This was the test. This was the judgment.
