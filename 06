# Chapter 06: The Green Bloom

---

The thing that was Jaxer, or perhaps *wore* Jaxer, took another stiff, deliberate step. The faint green glow from within its helmet intensified, and the rhythmic hum that permeated the relay station seemed to pulse in time with its movements. Kaia could see tiny, crystalline filaments, like viridescent veins, now visibly tracing paths across the exposed joints of Jaxer’s armor, anchoring him to the larger, fungal network that was devouring the room.

“Jaxer?” Felix’s voice was tight, his rifle still aimed, but his finger hesitant on the trigger. “Buddy, you in there?”

The assimilated Jaxer didn’t respond with words. Instead, its head snapped towards Felix with an unnatural speed. One of its hands, now partially encrusted with the same sickly green crystals that adorned the consoles, shot out. It wasn’t a human movement; it was too fast, too precise, like a piston driven by an unseen force. Felix yelped, barely managing to sidestep as crystalline shards, sharp as obsidian, erupted from the assimilated Jaxer’s fingertips, scoring deep gouges in the plasteel wall where he’d been standing.

“Guess not!” Kaia yelled, finally breaking her own stunned horror. She fired a burst from her rifle, not at Jaxer’s center mass, but at the crystalline growths on his shoulder. If he was a puppet, maybe she could cut the strings.

The pulse bolts hit true, shattering the green crystals on his armor. The assimilated Jaxer staggered, a low, grating sound emanating from its helmet – a sound that was decidedly not human. But the effect was momentary. New filaments, thicker and more vibrant, instantly snaked out from the floor and walls, re-anchoring to its armor, the shattered crystals regrowing with visible speed, blooming like grotesque, time-lapsed flowers.

*Kaia, its connection to the local crystalline matrix is… total,* Mileo’s voice was a strained whisper in her HUD, the static around his signal worsening. *It’s drawing power directly from the network it’s creating. Damaging the ‘host’ body is… likely ineffective as long as the matrix is intact.*

“So we can’t shoot the puppet, we have to go for the puppeteer,” Kaia muttered, dodging another swipe from the Jaxer-thing. Its movements were becoming more fluid, less stiff, as if it was learning to control its new body with increasing efficiency. The sweet, cloying odor in the room intensified, making her gag.

“The central console!” Felix shouted, firing a volley that forced the assimilated Jaxer to shield its head with a crystal-coated arm. “That’s the heart of this… this green cancer!”

He was right. The main console, now almost entirely engulfed in the pulsating green crystalline mass, was clearly the nexus of this localized infestation. But getting to it meant getting past their former teammate.

The assimilated Jaxer lunged, no longer just swiping but moving with a terrifying, predatory grace. It was faster now, stronger. Kaia parried a blow with her rifle stock, the impact jarring her to the bone. The creature – she couldn’t think of it as Jaxer anymore – didn’t even flinch.

Felix tried to circle around it, to get a clear shot at the console, but the Jaxer-thing seemed aware, its head tracking his movements even as it pressed its attack on Kaia. Filaments lashed out from its back, like sentient whips, forcing Felix to dance back.

“It’s using the network as an extension of its senses!” Kaia realized, gritting her teeth as she kicked out, connecting with the Jaxer-thing’s knee. The joint buckled, but only for a second before the crystals seemed to reinforce it.

*The console, Kaia! It’s drawing more power! The entire relay station is becoming a… a conductor!* Mileo’s warning was dire.

Kaia knew they didn’t have much time. This thing was a self-repairing, networked horror. And it was learning.

“Felix! Plan B!” Kaia yelled. “Blow the damn console! Forget surgical, go for messy!”

Felix didn’t need telling twice. He unslung a breaching charge from his belt. “Cover me!”

Kaia threw herself at the Jaxer-thing, a desperate tackle. They both went down in a tangle of limbs and cracking crystal. She could feel the unnatural strength of it, the cold, unyielding surface of the crystalline growths beneath the armor. The green glow from its helmet was inches from her face, and for a horrifying moment, she saw past the darkened visor – not Jaxer’s eyes, but swirling, viridescent pinpricks of light, alien and utterly devoid of humanity.

A filament, needle-sharp, extended from its gauntlet, aiming for her throat.

“Felix, NOW!”

Felix, having slapped the breaching charge onto the side of the grotesquely blooming console, was scrambling back. “Fire in the hole!”

Kaia kicked out, rolling away from the Jaxer-thing just as Felix hit the detonator.

The explosion was contained but brutal. The central console erupted in a shower of shattered crystal, fried circuits, and acrid green smoke. The rhythmic hum of the room instantly flatlined, replaced by the shriek of tearing metal and collapsing systems.

The Jaxer-thing froze mid-lunge, its body convulsing violently. The green glow within its helmet flickered and died. The crystalline growths covering its armor cracked, turned dull, and began to crumble into dust. With a final, shuddering sigh that sounded like air escaping a punctured lung, the armored figure collapsed, truly lifeless this time.

Kaia lay on the floor, gasping for breath, the acrid smoke burning her lungs. Felix was already at her side, helping her up.

“You okay?”

“Define okay,” she coughed. They both looked at Jaxer’s still form. The green was gone. He just looked like… a fallen soldier. The silence in the room was heavy, broken only by the crackle of dying electronics.

*The localized network… it’s collapsed,* Mileo confirmed, his signal still weak but clearer than before. *The primary node here is offline. But Kaia… the filaments… they weren’t just drawing power. They were transmitting. Data.*

Kaia felt a cold dread seep into her bones, colder than the damp air of the relay. “Transmitting what, Mileo? To where?”

*I… I don’t know. The patterns were complex, encrypted. But it was an upload. Significant bandwidth. Whatever this node learned, whatever it assimilated from Jaxer… it sent it out before it died.*

Felix cursed, kicking a piece of debris. “So we stopped this one. But it called home first.”

Kaia stared at Jaxer’s body. They couldn’t take him with them. They couldn’t even give him a proper burial here. The cost of this fight was mounting, not just in lives, but in the terrifying understanding of their enemy. It wasn’t just evolving. It was learning from them. From their technology. From their biology.

“We need to get out of here,” Kaia said, her voice hollow. “And we need to warn the enclave. This isn’t just about old tech anymore. It’s coming for *us*.”

The green bloom had been pruned, but its seeds were now scattered on the wind.
