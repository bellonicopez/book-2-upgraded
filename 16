# Chapter 15: The Ghost in the Genes

---

Mileo’s words – *“It is searching for a specific genetic lineage. A bloodline.”* – hung in the main chamber of the enclave, heavy and suffocating. The hum of the life support systems, the distant clang of a sentry checking a barricade, even their own breathing, seemed amplified in the sudden, profound silence.

Kaia felt a chill that had nothing to do with the ever-present dampness of their underground refuge. A bloodline. Not just random assimilation, but a targeted hunt for individuals whose very genes were a relic of Project Chimera, a key to… what? Perfected assimilation? Control over the Warden’s monstrous creations? The possibilities were all terrifying.

“A bloodline,” Ryn finally echoed, his voice barely a whisper. He ran a trembling hand through his hair. “How… how do we even begin to look for something like that? We don’t have a city-wide genetic database. Most Old World records are corrupted dust!”

“And even if we did,” Lena added, her face pale, her earlier excitement about her discovery now replaced with a deep unease, “what then? Do we round up everyone with these markers? What if they don’t even know? What if it’s… one of us?”

Her gaze flickered around the room, a subtle, almost unconscious sweep that Kaia knew everyone else felt. The seed of paranoia, once sown by the fear of assimilation, now had fertile new ground. Who among them carried this ghost in their genes?

Kora, ever practical, asked, “Mileo, can you give us any more specifics? Names? Locations where this lineage was last recorded? Anything that could narrow the search?”

Mileo’s light on the terminal pulsed weakly. *“The Warden’s archives were… compartmentalized. Accessing personnel records linked to Project Chimera was beyond my capabilities before the countermeasures severed my connection. The lineage was referred to by a codename: ‘Lineage Primus.’ Its members were… closely monitored. Their genetic data was considered a critical asset. But specific identifiers, post-Project Chimera’s active phase, are… elusive. The trail goes cold shortly before The Architect’s rise.”*

“So, they could be anywhere. Anyone,” Felix stated bluntly, his arms crossed. He looked less flippant than usual, the implications clearly weighing on him. “Great. Just great. We’re looking for a needle in a haystack, and the needle doesn’t even know it’s a needle, and the entity’s got a high-tech needle-detector.”

Kaia understood their despair. It was a monumental, almost impossible task. But inaction was a death sentence. “We have to try. If the entity finds this… Lineage Primus… it could gain an unimaginable advantage.”

“But how, Kaia?” Ryn pressed. “We’re barely holding this enclave together. We don’t have the resources for a city-wide genetic screening, even if we knew exactly what to screen for beyond ‘anomalous markers’.”

“We start with what we *do* know,” Kaia said, forcing a firmness into her voice she didn’t entirely feel. “The entity is interested in Old World medical facilities. It was drawn to Serenity General, not just for the cryo-pods, but for the pathology data. It’s looking for records, for traces.”

She turned to Lena and Kora. “The markers you identified – are they common enough that we could discreetly screen the enclave’s population? Without causing a panic?”

Lena hesitated. “Some of the individual markers, yes. But the specific *combination* that Mileo mentioned… that would be rare. Very rare. We could run comparative analyses on existing medical data we have for enclave members – blood types, old medical histories, anything that might give a hint. But it would be a long shot, and potentially… divisive if people found out what we were looking for.”

The ethical tightrope was fraying.

“And what if we find someone?” Kora asked softly. “What do we do? Tell them they’re a target? Lock them away? That sounds a lot like what the Old World did with Project Chimera’s ‘assets’.”

The parallel was uncomfortable and unavoidable.

Kaia looked at her team, at the faces of the people who trusted her. The weight of leadership felt heavier than ever. “Our first priority is to stop the entity. If this lineage is key to its plans, we need to find them before it does. To warn them. To protect them. Not to… use them.” She hoped she sounded convincing. She hoped she believed it herself.

*“Kaia,”* Mileo’s voice interjected, a little stronger now, as if he’d marshaled his failing resources. *“There is one avenue. The entity’s search patterns. While it was accessing the Serenity pathology data, its algorithms were not just looking for matches; they were building a predictive model. Trying to extrapolate potential descendants based on fragmented genetic records and demographic data from the Old World.”*

“Can you access that model?” Kaia asked, a flicker of hope igniting.

*“I… intercepted fragments of it. It’s incomplete. Highly encrypted. But it suggests the entity is focusing its search on specific districts of Neo-Citania. Areas that had high concentrations of… let’s call them ‘specialized medical research facilities’ during the late Old World era. Places that weren’t as prominent as Serenity General, but may have housed subjects or personnel linked to Lineage Primus after the main project was… ostensibly shut down.”*

“Districts?” Ryn leaned forward. “Which ones?”

Mileo projected a flickering map of Neo-Citania onto the main display. Several dilapidated sectors, mostly on the city’s perilous, ruin-choked periphery, were highlighted.

“These areas are almost entirely un-patrolled,” Felix noted grimly. “No-go zones, even for us. Full of structural collapses, toxic zones… and who knows what else.”

“If the entity is focusing its search there,” Kaia said, her gaze fixed on the map, “then that’s where we need to look for clues. Not necessarily for living members of this lineage – the chances of that are slim. But for records. For anything that might tell us who they were, where they went. Something that can give us a name, a face, to this ghost.”

It was a desperate plan, venturing into the most dangerous parts of the city based on fragmented data from their enemy’s own predictive models. But it was the only plan they had.

“We’ll need a small team. Fast, quiet,” Kaia decided. “Felix, you’re with me. Ryn, you and Mileo try to refine that predictive model, find the most likely locations for intact records within those districts. Lena, Kora, continue your analysis here. If anyone in this enclave matches even a *part* of that genetic profile, I need to know. Discreetly.”

The mood in the enclave shifted. The despair didn’t vanish, but it was now overlaid with a grim, focused determination. They had a direction, however perilous.

As they prepared, Kaia couldn’t shake a nagging thought. The entity was building a predictive model to find this bloodline. But what if the Warden, with its two centuries of uninterrupted guardianship and access to Project Chimera’s core data, already knew exactly where Lineage Primus, or its descendants, could be found?

The cycle continues. The Warden’s words felt less like a philosophical statement and more like a quiet, patient threat.
