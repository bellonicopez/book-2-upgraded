# Chapter 16: The Ashfall District

---

The Ashfall District. Even the name tasted like grit and despair. It was one of the sectors Mileo’s fragmented predictive model had highlighted, an area on the city’s western fringe that had supposedly housed several small, discreet bio-research labs in the twilight years of the Old World. Now, it was a skeletal ruin, perpetually shrouded in a haze of fine, grey dust that gave it its moniker – the result of a massive, uncontrolled industrial fire decades ago that had never truly been extinguished, just smoldered into a toxic, permanent blight.

Kaia and Felix picked their way through the treacherous streets in a stripped-down, agile scout crawler, its engine muffled as much as possible. The usual cacophony of Neo-Citania was absent here, replaced by an eerie silence broken only by the groan of stressed metal from collapsing structures and the whisper of the ever-present ash settling like a macabre shroud. Visibility was poor, the ashfall reducing it to a few dozen meters, painting everything in a monochrome palette of greys.

“Charming,” Felix muttered, his voice tight through the crawler’s internal comms. His hand rarely strayed from the mounted pulse cannon controls. “If the entity doesn’t get us, the lung-rot will. You sure this is the place, Mileo?”

*“The probability models indicate a significant concentration of Old World medical data archives within a two-block radius of your current position, Felix,”* Mileo’s voice, still weak but painstakingly precise, crackled back. *“Specifically, a facility codenamed ‘Pinnacle Genetics.’ Its primary focus, according to fragmented manifests, was ‘hereditary trait analysis and enhancement’.”*

“Hereditary traits. Sounds about right,” Kaia said, her eyes scanning the ghostly outlines of crumbling buildings. Their atmospheric filters were working overtime, but she could still taste the metallic tang of the ash. “Pinnacle Genetics. Doesn’t exactly scream ‘secret lab for Project Chimera offshoots’.”

*“Discretion was paramount for such facilities, Kaia. Their public-facing operations were often mundane. The true research… compartmentalized.”*

They found what Ryn’s architectural overlays suggested was Pinnacle Genetics. It was a surprisingly unassuming three-story building, its façade relatively intact despite the surrounding decay, though its windows were dark, ash-caked voids. The main entrance was blocked by a mountain of collapsed debris from a neighboring skyscraper.

“Looks like we’re not using the front door,” Felix observed. “Any suggestions, digital ghost?”

*“Scans indicate a subterranean access point. A reinforced loading bay on the building’s north face. Likely sealed, but potentially less obstructed.”*

They navigated the crawler through a narrow, rubble-strewn alley. The loading bay door was, as Mileo predicted, sealed – a massive slab of rusted plasteel. But time and neglect had weakened its moorings.

“A couple of well-placed breaching charges should do it,” Felix said, already hopping out of the crawler, his kit in hand. The air outside was thick, the ash swirling around him like malevolent spirits.

Kaia joined him, her pulse rifle at the ready, covering their backs. The silence here was different from the cryo-chambers of Serenity General. That had been a cold, sterile silence. This was a dead, suffocating silence, heavy with the weight of forgotten lives and toxic decay.

The charges blew the door inward with a protesting screech of metal. Beyond lay a ramp descending into darkness, the air thick with the smell of stagnant water and chemical residue.

“After you,” Felix said, gesturing with a mock bow.

They proceeded on foot, their suit lights cutting sharp cones through the oppressive gloom. The loading bay opened into a series of subterranean corridors and storage rooms. Water damage was extensive; collapsed ceilings and flooded sections were common. Most of the equipment was ruined, caked in mud and ash.

“If there were records here, they’re likely pulp by now,” Kaia muttered, shining her light on a shelf of disintegrated data-binders.

*“Focus on reinforced storage units or hermetically sealed archives, Kaia,”* Mileo advised. *“Standard record-keeping would not survive these conditions. Look for vault-like structures, often located in the facility’s core.”*

They pressed deeper, the sense of unease growing with every step. This place felt… wrong. Not just abandoned, but tainted. In one lab, they found rows of shattered specimen jars, their contents long desiccated or leached away. In another, strange, oversized cages, their bars bent and broken from the inside.

“Doesn’t look like they were studying hereditary traits in petunias,” Felix commented grimly, nudging a twisted metal bar with his boot.

Finally, in what seemed to be the central records area, they found it: a heavy vault door, surprisingly intact, though its electronic lock was dark and unresponsive. A faded stencil on the door read: ‘ARCHIVE 7 – RESTRICTED – BIOHAZARD PROTOCOL GAMMA.’

“Biohazard Protocol Gamma. That’s not ominous at all,” Felix said. “Think you can crack this one, Kaia? Or do I get to make another loud noise?”

Kaia examined the lock. It was an old magnetic-cipher system. She’d bypassed a few in her Iron Veil days. “Might take a while. And I’ll need absolute quiet.”

Felix nodded, taking up a defensive position, his light sweeping the corridor. “You got it. I’ll play scarecrow.”

Minutes stretched into an eternity as Kaia worked, the delicate clicks of her tools unnaturally loud in the silence. The ash seemed to settle even here, deep underground. Twice, she thought she heard movement in the distant, flooded corridors – the scuttling of rats, perhaps, or something larger.

Finally, with a satisfying thunk, the magnetic bolts retracted. The heavy vault door hissed, releasing a puff of stale, strangely sterile air.

Inside, it was a small, circular room, lined floor to ceiling with metallic data cylinders, each slotted into a numbered recess. A single terminal stood in the center, dark and lifeless.

“Jackpot,” Kaia breathed, a wave of relief washing over her.

*“Excellent, Kaia,”* Mileo’s voice was tinged with digital approval. *“These cylinders are likely high-density optical storage, designed for long-term preservation. If records of Lineage Primus exist in this facility, they will be here.”*

Kaia approached the terminal. “Can you interface with it, Mileo? Power it up?”

*“Attempting… The local power grid is offline. I will try to reroute auxiliary power from your suit, but it will be a slow process. And the data retrieval… it will take time to sift through these archives.”*

As Mileo worked his digital magic, Felix stepped into the vault, his light playing over the cylinders. “So, which one of these has the winning lottery ticket? Or, you know, the name of the poor sap the entity wants to turn into its next super-freak.”

Kaia’s gaze swept across the racks. Most cylinders were labeled with alphanumeric codes. But one, set slightly apart from the others, caught her eye. It bore no complex code, only a single, stark symbol: a stylized, minimalist drawing of a serpent coiled around a leafless tree. And beneath it, almost too faded to read, two words:

*“Project: Yggdrasil.”*

Before she could ask Mileo about it, a new sound echoed from the corridor outside – a low, guttural chittering, followed by the distinct splash of something heavy moving through the flooded sections. It was not rats.

Felix spun, his rifle up. “Company’s here. And they don’t sound friendly.”

The hunt for a ghost in the genes had just awakened something else in the Ashfall District.
