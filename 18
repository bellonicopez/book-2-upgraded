# Chapter 18: The Serpent's Coil

---

The scout crawler, caked in a thick layer of grey ash and something far more repulsive from their encounter with the Ash Children, limped back into the enclave under the worried gaze of the sentries. The decontamination showers were immediate and thorough, a harsh chemical scrubbing followed by UV irradiation. Kaia and Felix endured it stoically, the memory of those chittering, pale horrors still fresh in their minds. The Yggdrasil cylinder, carefully sealed in a biohazard containment bag, underwent its own even more rigorous sterilization protocol.

Once cleared, they found Ryn, Lena, and Kora waiting in the main operations chamber, their faces etched with a mixture of anxiety and anticipation. Mileo’s terminal pulsed with a slightly more stable, though still dim, light.

“Report,” Ryn said, his voice tight. “Pinnacle Genetics – what did you find?”

Kaia placed the now-sterilized Yggdrasil cylinder on the central console. “We found their ‘Archive 7’. And these.” She gestured to the cylinder. “Project: Yggdrasil. Mileo managed a partial data download before we were… interrupted.”

Felix shuddered dramatically. “Interrupted by the welcoming committee. Let’s call them the ‘Ash Children.’ Pale, nasty, lots of teeth, climb walls. Don’t recommend the Pinnacle Genetics tour unless you’re really into extreme pest control.”

Lena’s eyes widened. “Escaped subjects? Like Mileo theorized?”

“Looks like it,” Kaia confirmed. “The place was a cesspit. But this cylinder… it was stored separately, marked differently. Mileo, the download – what have you got?”

*“The Yggdrasil data fragment is… heavily corrupted, as I suspected,”* Mileo’s synthesized voice emanated from the terminal. His vocalizer seemed a little stronger, perhaps the focused effort of the download had, paradoxically, helped stabilize some of his systems. *“Encryption layers are unlike anything I’ve encountered. Ancient, but incredibly sophisticated. However, I was able to extract some preliminary metadata and a few recurring visual markers before the connection was lost.”*

On the main display, a series of images flickered. The most prominent was the symbol Kaia had seen on the cylinder: the stylized serpent coiled around a leafless tree. It was repeated in various forms, sometimes incorporated into complex diagrams, sometimes as a standalone emblem. There were also fragmented schematics of what looked like advanced genetic sequencing equipment, and unsettlingly, diagrams that seemed to show crystalline structures being integrated into organic cellular matrices.

“The serpent and the tree,” Ryn mused, leaning closer to the display. “Yggdrasil. The World Tree from Old Norse mythology. The serpent… Níðhöggr? The dragon that gnaws at its roots?”

“Mythology?” Kaia frowned. “What does that have to do with genetic experiments?”

“Old World scientists, especially the more… esoteric ones, loved their classical allusions,” Lena supplied. “It lent a veneer of gravitas, or perhaps romanticism, to their work. But the imagery is potent. A world tree, life itself. A serpent, often a symbol of knowledge, poison, or primordial chaos, gnawing at its roots.”

*“The metadata confirms Project: Yggdrasil was a core component of the research that led to Project Chimera,”* Mileo stated. *“It appears to have focused on achieving stable integration of inorganic crystalline structures with organic tissue – specifically, with subjects possessing the ‘Lineage Primus’ genetic markers.”*

“So, Yggdrasil wasn’t just about making monsters,” Kaia said slowly, the pieces clicking into place. “It was about making them *stable*. Using Lineage Primus as the… the fertile ground for these crystalline augmentations.”

Kora looked disturbed. “The Ash Children… they didn’t have crystalline structures, did they? They were just… mutated.”

“Failed experiments, maybe?” Felix suggested. “The ones who *didn’t* have the right stuff? Or maybe Yggdrasil was trying to perfect the *organic* side before adding the crystal crunchies.”

*“The Yggdrasil data also contains heavily encrypted personnel files,”* Mileo continued. *“I have only managed to decrypt a single designation associated with the project’s lead researcher: ‘Dr. Alistair Thorne. Status: Terminated – Incident Epsilon-7’.”*

“Alistair Thorne,” Ryn typed the name into his console, searching the enclave’s limited databases. “Nothing. Completely scrubbed. ‘Incident Epsilon-7’… also a ghost.”

“The Old World was good at burying its mistakes,” Kaia said grimly. “And its monsters.” She picked up the physical Yggdrasil cylinder. “Mileo, can you try a direct interface with this? Maybe a physical connection will yield more than the remote download did.”

*“It is possible, Kaia. But the cylinder’s internal security protocols are likely still active. A forced interface could result in data erasure. Or… unforeseen consequences. The Ash Children were a biological defense. This cylinder might have digital ones.”*

The warning was clear.

Lena, who had been quietly studying the serpent symbol on the display, suddenly spoke up. “That symbol… I’ve seen variations of it before. Not exact, but similar. In some of the Old World medical texts Ryn archived. Associated with fringe research groups, often discredited, working on ‘radical human augmentation’.”

“Fringe groups that somehow got funding for places like Pinnacle Genetics and fed into Project Chimera,” Kaia mused. “This Dr. Thorne… he wasn’t just a scientist. He was part of something bigger, something ideological.”

The Yggdrasil cylinder felt cold and heavy in her hand. It was a key, she was sure of it. But to what door? And what horrors lay beyond?

“We need to access the data on this cylinder, Mileo,” Kaia said, her decision made. “Whatever the risk. If Lineage Primus is the key to the entity’s plans, and Yggdrasil was the project that first exploited that lineage for crystalline augmentation… the answers we need are in here.”

Ryn looked worried. “Kaia, if it has digital countermeasures…”

“Then Mileo is our best defense,” Kaia stated, meeting his gaze. She turned to the terminal. “Mileo, prepare for direct interface. Let’s see what secrets Dr. Thorne and his serpent wanted to keep buried.”

The dim light on Mileo’s terminal seemed to steady, to brighten almost imperceptibly, as if accepting the challenge. The enclave fell silent once more, the weight of the Old World’s legacy pressing down, coiled and waiting, like the serpent around the tree.
