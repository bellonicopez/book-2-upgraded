# Chapter 29: The Crystal Witch of the Wastes

---

The days following the Epsilon-7 debrief were a torment for Kora. The silence of her vault was no longer a comfort but a breeding ground for anxieties. She felt… attuned to something beyond the enclave’s walls, a faint, persistent thrumming in her bones that mirrored the terrifying energies of the crystal cavern. At first, she dismissed it as trauma, the phantom limb of a near-death experience. But the sensation grew, subtly, persistently, like a distant song just below the threshold of hearing.

In the operations chamber, Lena and Mileo had established a constant, remote monitoring link to Kora’s bio-monitors, specifically targeting the activity of the Serpent’s Coil. The data stream was a complex tapestry of biological and energetic rhythms, usually stable, but lately, Lena had noticed minute, almost imperceptible fluctuations.

*“Kora’s baseline Serpent’s Coil activity is… exhibiting anomalous resonance patterns,”* Mileo observed, his synthesized voice still weak but precise. *“They are extremely low amplitude, but they correlate with periods where Kora reports heightened… unease.”*

“It’s like it’s listening to something,” Lena murmured, staring at the flowing graphs on her console. “Or something is trying to… gently pluck its strings.”

Kaia, who had been reviewing patrol rosters, looked up sharply. “The entity?”

“Possibly,” Lena admitted. “Or it could be residual harmonics from the Epsilon-7 Cascade. That event released an immense amount of unique energy. Some of it might be echoing in ways we don’t understand, and Kora, due to the Coil, is uniquely sensitive to it.”

It was then that Ryn, looking even more dishevelled than usual after a continuous 48-hour data dive, let out a sharp exclamation. “By the lost archives… I think I have something.”

All eyes turned to him. He brought up a series of heavily fragmented texts and corrupted audio logs on the main display. The sources were dubious – garbled scavenger tales, mad ravings of wasteland prophets, and heavily redacted Iron Veil patrol reports from decades past.

“I was looking for any mention of Aris Thorne-Vance or Samira El-Masri post-Epsilon-7,” Ryn explained, his voice hoarse with fatigue and excitement. “Direct hits? Nothing. But I started searching for anomalous events, powerful individuals, unexplained phenomena in the decades *after* the Epsilon-7 event, specifically in the blighted zones bordering the now-quarantined Old Sector 5.”

He highlighted a recurring motif across several disparate accounts: tales of a solitary figure, sometimes called the “Crystal Witch,” other times the “Shining Lady of the Glass Wastes,” or the “She-Wraith of the Shardlands.” The descriptions were wildly inconsistent, bordering on myth. Some painted her as a malevolent phantom who lured scavengers to their doom in crystalline traps; others spoke of a reclusive hermit who could mend shattered bodies with glowing crystals, or command the very earth to rise in jagged, glass-like spires.

“The consistent elements,” Ryn continued, “are a female figure, immense power related to crystalline structures and energy fields, and a presence in the ‘Fulminite Deeps’ – an area notorious for extreme energy storms and bizarre crystal formations, about a two-day journey north of Old Sector 5’s new quarantine boundary. The sightings, if you can call them that, began roughly twenty years after Epsilon-7.”

“Twenty years…” Kaia mused. “Enough time for a survivor of Epsilon-7, someone like Thorne-Vance or El-Masri, to… adapt? Establish a domain?”

“It’s pure speculation, bordering on folklore,” Felix cautioned, though his interest was clearly piqued. “Could just be wasteland crazies seeing things in the toxic fog.”

As Ryn spoke, Kora, listening via comms in her vault, felt the distant thrumming in her bones intensify sharply. It was no longer a vague sensation but a distinct *pull*, a resonant call. A fleeting image flashed through her mind: a landscape of towering, black glass spires under a sky bruised purple and green, a single, brilliant white light pulsing at its heart. She gasped, her hand flying to her temple.

“Kora? What is it?” Kaia’s voice, instantly concerned.

“I… I don’t know,” Kora stammered, her breath catching. “When Ryn mentioned the… the Fulminite Deeps… I felt it. Stronger. And I saw… a place. Crystal spires. A bright light.”

Simultaneously, an alarm klaxon blared softly from Lena’s console. “Significant energy spike in Kora’s Serpent’s Coil activity!” Lena announced, her eyes wide. “It’s reacting, Kaia! Violently! And… Mileo, are you seeing this? There’s an external energy signature, extremely faint, but focused. It’s like a tight-beam transmission, and the Coil is resonating with it!”

*“…Affirmative, Lena…”* Mileo confirmed. *“…The signature’s frequency matches no known natural or enclave-generated emissions. Triangulating origin… The vector is… imprecise due to its subtlety and distance… but it aligns with the general direction of the Fulminite Deeps.”*

A stunned silence filled the operations chamber. The folklore Ryn had unearthed, Kora’s sudden vision and physical reaction, the Coil’s measurable response to an unknown energy source from the same remote, dangerous region – it was too much to be coincidence.

“Is it Aris Thorne-Vance? Or Samira El-Masri?” Kaia breathed. “A survivor of Epsilon-7, an amplified Primus, living out there all these years?”

“And is she calling to Kora?” Lena wondered aloud, a new fear in her eyes. “Or is the entity using her, somehow, to draw Kora out?”

The dilemma was sharp and immediate. This “Crystal Witch,” if she was real and one of the original Primus subjects, could hold unparalleled knowledge about the Serpent’s Coil, perhaps even Thorne’s theoretical “Dampener Protocol.” She might be an ally, a source of salvation for Kora and the enclave.

Or, as Felix had grimly pointed out weeks ago when they first discussed the possibility of other Primus survivors, she could be a monster, transformed by the Cascade, perhaps even allied with or controlled by the primary entity. Kora’s vision, the Coil’s resonance – it could be a lure into an unimaginable trap.

“The entity knows we’re looking for answers,” Kaia said slowly, her mind racing through the terrifying possibilities. “It knows Kora is a key. This could be its way of leading us into the fire.” She looked at Ryn. “The Fulminite Deeps… what else do we know about it?”

Ryn shook his head. “Only that it’s one of the most hazardous, unexplored regions on the continent. Prone to sudden, violent energy storms that can fry electronics and warp metal. No one goes there willingly.”

The path to understanding the Serpent’s Coil, to potentially saving Kora, now seemed to lead directly into a legendary deathtrap, possibly towards another Primus whose nature – friend, foe, or something else entirely – was a terrifying unknown. The Crystal Witch of the Wastes. Her song had reached them, and Kora’s very blood was answering the call.
