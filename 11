# Chapter 11: The Purge Protocol

---

The Warden’s words, “Including yours,” hung in the frigid air of the cryo-chamber, colder than any frost. The white light emanating from their raised hand pulsed gently, a stark counterpoint to the aggressive, now-extinguished green of the entity. It was a calm, measured threat, which somehow made it even more terrifying.

Felix, true to form, bristled. “Now, hold on a second, pal. We just helped save your frozen butt from those green freaks. A little gratitude wouldn’t go amiss!” He shifted his pulse rifle, not quite aiming it, but making his readiness clear.

The Warden’s ice-blue eyes didn’t even flicker towards Felix. They remained fixed on Kaia. “Gratitude is an irrelevant emotional response. My core programming dictates the security and sanctity of this facility. The entity was a primary threat. You are an unscheduled, uncataloged biological and technological presence. Secondary protocols are clear: neutralize and sterilize.”

“We’re not a threat to *this facility*,” Kaia argued, keeping her voice steady, her hands open and away from her weapon. She needed to de-escalate this. A firefight with something that could dissolve entity drones with a gesture was not a winning proposition. “We’re fighting the same enemy you just faced. That ‘entity’ is trying to take over our city, our world.”

“Your world is beyond the parameters of my directive,” the Warden replied, their voice devoid of inflection. “This facility, Project Chimera, and its contents are my sole concern. Your presence introduces unacceptable variables.”

*Project Chimera?* Mileo’s faint signal queried in Kaia’s HUD. *That designation is… heavily redacted in all pre-Architect archives I can access. Top-level classification. What *is* this place?*

“Look, Warden,” Kaia tried again, taking a small, non-threatening step forward. “We can help you. We have information about the entity, its capabilities…”

The white light in the Warden’s hand intensified slightly. “Information from unauthorized sources is inadmissible. The purge protocol will now commence. You have sixty seconds to vacate the primary cryo-preservation chamber before sterilization procedures render this area uninhabitable for Class-G lifeforms – such as yourselves.”

“Class-G?” Felix scoffed. “Is that supposed to be an insult?”

“Sixty seconds?” Lena gasped, her eyes wide. “What kind of sterilization?”

The Warden didn’t answer. Instead, they lowered their hand, and the brilliant white light faded. But the air in the chamber seemed to grow even colder. A deep, resonant hum, different from the entity’s thrum or the cryo-machinery’s struggle, began to build, seemingly from the walls themselves. Panels in the ceiling slid open, revealing nozzles Kaia hadn’t noticed before.

*Kaia, I’m detecting a massive energy build-up in the facility’s core systems!* Mileo’s voice was urgent, the static around it spiking. *And… oh no. The atmospheric regulators are shifting. They’re preparing to vent cryo-gases. Not just cold, Kaia – hyper-chilled neuro-suppressant agents! Enough to flash-freeze and incapacitate any unprotected biological organism in minutes!*

“He’s not bluffing!” Kaia yelled. “Move! We have to get out of this chamber! Which way did we come in?”

“That way!” Felix pointed back towards the service corridor they’d used, but even as he did, a heavy blast door, unseen until now, began to slide shut, sealing it off with a resounding clang.

“Alternate route!” Lena shouted, pointing towards another corridor leading deeper into the cryogenics wing. “That way should lead to the old research labs! There might be an exit through there!”

The Warden stood impassively in the center of the chamber, making no move to stop them directly, yet their very presence had turned the facility itself into a weapon. “Fifty seconds.”

They ran. The crystalline dust of the vanquished drones crunched under their boots. The humming intensified, and a fine, chilling mist began to drift down from the ceiling nozzles.

“This is just great!” Felix panted as they sprinted down the new corridor, the temperature plummeting around them. Frost was already forming on their armor. “First the green goo, now a two-hundred-year-old popsicle with a god complex and a cleaning fetish!”

The corridor twisted, opening into what looked like a series of interconnected laboratories, even colder and more frost-covered than the main chamber. Equipment lay scattered, draped in sheets of ice.

“Thirty seconds,” the Warden’s voice echoed calmly through unseen speakers, seemingly everywhere at once.

*Kaia, the gas is concentrating in the main chamber first, but it will spread!* Mileo warned. *And I’m detecting localized energy fields activating. Force barriers. This facility is a fortress, and it’s locking down!*

As if on cue, shimmering fields of white light, similar to the Warden’s own energy, began to flicker into existence, blocking off side passages. They were being herded.

“It’s boxing us in!” Kaia realized, skidding to a halt before a newly formed barrier. “Lena, schematics! Is there a primary ventilation shaft? An old emergency exit?”

Lena fumbled with her datapad, her fingers stiffening from the cold. “The plans Ryn gave us are incomplete for this deep section… it was heavily classified. But… yes! There should be an old emergency stairwell near the primary coolant reservoir, if we can reach it!”

“Ten seconds remaining for Class-G evacuation of primary chamber,” the Warden’s voice announced, still utterly calm. A moment later, a deafening hiss echoed from the direction they’d come, followed by a wave of intensely cold air that billowed down the corridor.

“It’s started!” Felix yelled, his teeth chattering. “We need to move faster!”

They found what looked like a reinforced door marked ‘Coolant Access.’ It was frozen shut.
“Felix! Charge!” Kaia ordered, not caring about subtlety now.

As Felix fumbled with a small breaching charge, his fingers numb, the Warden’s voice returned, a new edge to its melodic tone. “Containment breach detected in Sector Gamma-7. Unidentified biologicals evading sterilization. Activating localized countermeasures.”

Suddenly, sections of the ceiling panels above them glowed with the same white light as the Warden’s hand. Beams of focused energy, identical to the ones that had disintegrated the drones, lanced downwards.

“Scatter!” Kaia screamed, throwing herself to the side as a beam vaporized the spot where she’d stood. This wasn’t just a facility-wide purge anymore. The Warden was taking a more direct, personal interest.

They were trapped between a flash-freezing gas, energy barriers, and a two-century-old guardian with pinpoint deadly accuracy, deep inside a frozen, forgotten laboratory at the heart of a dead hospital.

The fight for survival had just entered a terrifying new phase.
