# Chapter 20: The Ghosts on the List

---

The acrid smell of ozone and burnt electronics hung heavy in the air. Emergency lights cast long, dancing shadows across the operations chamber, painting the scene in stark reds and deep blacks. Ryn worked frantically at a secondary console, bypassing fried circuits and rerouting power, his face illuminated by the erratic glow of diagnostic screens. Lena and Kora were tending to Felix, who, despite his bravado, was nursing a ringing headache and a few minor burns from the exploding cylinder.

Kaia stood before Mileo’s ruined terminal, a knot of anxiety tightening in her chest. The main console was a blackened, melted wreck. Only the faint, distorted crackle from Ryn’s auxiliary speaker offered any hope.

*“…Auxiliary… power… stabilizing… Core matrix integrity… compromised… but redundant systems… holding… Data packet… containing Serpent’s Coil sequence and Lineage Primus subject list… successfully transferred to… Ryn’s secure server… prior to… catastrophic system failure…”* Mileo’s voice was a fractured whisper, each word an effort.

Relief, profound and sharp, washed over Kaia. “Mileo, can you hear me clearly? What’s your status?”

*“…Affirmative, Kaia… I am… diminished… Main processing unit… offline. Operating on… tertiary backups. My ability to interface with external systems… severely limited. But… I am functional.”*

“That’s all that matters right now,” Ryn interjected, wiping sweat from his brow. He’d managed to restore partial power to the main displays, bypassing Mileo’s direct terminal. “I have the data packet. It’s encrypted with Mileo’s own fail-safe, but he’s given me the decryption key.”

The atmosphere in the room shifted, the immediate crisis of Mileo’s survival giving way to a tense anticipation. The list. The names that could change everything.

Ryn’s fingers flew across his keyboard. A new file directory appeared on the main display. He clicked it. Two items materialized: one labeled ‘SERPENT_COIL_SEQ_FINAL.DAT’ and another ‘PRIMUS_SUBJECTS_PARTIAL.LST’.

“Let’s see these ghosts,” Kaia said, her voice quiet.

Ryn opened the list first. It was short, only seven names, each followed by a string of Old World identification numbers and a final, cryptic status marker.

**LINEAGE PRIMUS – COHORT ALPHA (THORNE ARCHIVE FRAGMENT)**

1.  ARIS THORNE-VANCE :: ID# 773-001-XV :: STATUS: ACTIVE (EPSILON-7)
2.  ELARA JADE SORENSON :: ID# 801-233-XQ :: STATUS: ACTIVE (EPSILON-7)
3.  KENJIRO TANAKA :: ID# 799-450-XW :: STATUS: DECEASED (DELTA INCIDENT)
4.  SAMIRA EL-MASRI :: ID# 802-118-XR :: STATUS: ACTIVE (EPSILON-7)
5.  MARKO VOLKOV :: ID# 798-607-XT :: STATUS: TRANSFERRED (PROJECT HYDRA)
6.  CHLOE ANNE WEBSTER :: ID# 800-003-XS :: STATUS: ACTIVE (EPSILON-7)
7.  LIAM ANSEL BECK :: ID# 803-521-XU :: STATUS: UNKNOWN (POST-EPSILON-7)

A heavy silence filled the room as they read the names. Ghosts from a forgotten war, fought in secret labs over the very essence of humanity.

“Aris Thorne-Vance?” Lena murmured, pointing at the first name. “Any relation to Dr. Alistair Thorne?”

“‘Thorne-Vance’… a hyphenated name, common in the late Old World for preserving family lines,” Ryn mused. “Possibly a son, a daughter? A niece or nephew? Someone Thorne had a vested, perhaps personal, interest in.”

“‘Status: Active (Epsilon-7)’,” Kaia read. “That incident again. Four of them share that status. Kenjiro Tanaka is listed as deceased in a ‘Delta Incident’. Marko Volkov… ‘Transferred (Project Hydra)’. Another project name. Gods, how many of these secret programs were there?”

“And Liam Ansel Beck,” Felix pointed out, his headache seemingly forgotten. “‘Status: Unknown (Post-Epsilon-7)’. He’s the only one unaccounted for after whatever Epsilon-7 was.”

Kora, who had been quiet until now, suddenly gasped, her eyes fixed on the sixth name. “Chloe Anne Webster… ID number 800-003-XS…” She looked at Ryn, her face pale. “Ryn, my grandmother… my mother’s mother… her maiden name was Webster. She rarely spoke of her family, said they were lost in the early chaos after The Architect. But she had an old data chip… with some family records. Her mother’s name was Chloe.”

The room went utterly still. Ryn stared at Kora, then frantically began typing at his console, accessing the enclave’s personnel records and cross-referencing them with Kora’s private data files she’d uploaded when she joined them.

“Kora, your grandmother’s full name was Anya Sharma, nee Anya Webster?” Ryn asked, his voice tight.
“Yes,” Kora whispered, her hand flying to her mouth.

“And her mother… Chloe Anne Webster… born in Old Sector 3… ID number…” Ryn trailed off, his eyes wide as he stared at his screen. He slowly turned to face them. “ID number 800-003-XS. It’s a perfect match.”

The implication hit them like a physical blow. Lineage Primus wasn’t just some abstract list of Old World ghosts. It was here. Now. Living among them. Kora, their quiet, steadfast medic, who had faced the entity’s touch and survived, was a direct descendant of one of Dr. Thorne’s original, pivotal subjects.

Kaia looked at Kora, seeing her in a new, terrifying light. Kora, whose resilience they had admired, whose recovery from the entity’s corruption had been remarkably swift… was it just her strength of will? Or was it the ghost in her genes, the Serpent’s Coil, that had protected her, that made her… different?

The entity was hunting for a bloodline. And one of its targets was standing right in front of them.

“The entity… when it touched me…” Kora’s voice trembled. “It wasn’t just random. It *knew*. Or it sensed… something.”

“It’s why you recovered so quickly,” Lena breathed, understanding dawning. “Your genetic makeup… it resisted the full corruption. It adapted.”

Kaia’s mind raced. Kora was the key. But was she a key to salvation, or a beacon that would draw the entity’s full, terrifying attention directly to their doorstep?

The hunt was no longer for a faceless ghost. The ghost had a name, and she was one of their own.
