# Chapter 30: The Siren's Call

---

The revelation of the "Crystal Witch" and Kora’s resonant reaction cast a long, uneasy shadow over the operations chamber. The air, already thick with the accumulated stress of weeks spent on a knife’s edge, grew heavier still. The path forward, if one could even call it that, seemed to lead only into deeper, more treacherous unknowns.

“The Fulminate Deeps,” Felix said, breaking the silence, his voice flat. “Even the Iron Veil hard-cases whisper that name like it’s cursed. Energy storms that can turn a man to ash or fuse a crawler’s engine block solid in seconds. Ground that shifts like water. And now, apparently, a resident ‘Crystal Witch’ who might be a Primus survivor or an entity-puppet.” He shook his head. “This isn’t a mission; it’s a suicide run.”

Ryn, despite his exhaustion, was already pulling up any available data on the region. “He’s not wrong. The few reliable survey fragments we have paint a picture of extreme geological and energetic instability. It’s a zone where the planet’s crust is thin, riddled with geothermal vents and deposits of highly volatile, naturally occurring crystalline structures – ‘Fulminite’ being the common scavenger term for the most unstable variants. These crystals seem to react violently to atmospheric pressure changes and electromagnetic fluctuations, triggering the infamous energy storms.”

“And this ‘Witch’ lives there?” Lena asked, her skepticism warring with the undeniable evidence of Kora’s reaction. “How could anyone survive that, Primus or not?”

*“…A Lineage Primus subject, particularly one who survived and adapted to the Epsilon-7 Cascade, might possess a unique symbiosis with such an environment…”* Mileo theorized. *“…The Serpent’s Coil, as an amplifier and receiver, could allow for a degree of… harmonization with the ambient energies, rather than destruction by them. They might even be able to… influence or direct the crystal formations, explaining the folklore of ‘commanding the earth’.”*

The thought of a Primus wielding such power, shaped by decades of isolation in such a hostile land, was sobering.

Kaia looked at Kora, who was observing the discussion on a monitor in her vault, her face pale but her expression intently focused. “Kora, this… this call you felt, the vision. Can you describe it further? Did it feel like a warning? An invitation?”

Kora hesitated. “It… it didn’t feel malevolent. Not like the entity’s presence. It was… clearer. Like a pure note, resonating with something deep inside me. The vision was brief – black glass spires, a violet-green sky, and a single, brilliant white light at the heart of it. It felt… significant. Like something I was meant to see.”

“Or something someone *wants* you to see,” Felix interjected grimly. “A lure, plain and simple. The entity knows we’re desperate for answers about the Coil. What better way to draw us out than to dangle a potential Primus survivor in the most dangerous place imaginable?”

“He has a point,” Kaia conceded. “If this is a trap, and Kora is the bait, taking her there would be handing the entity exactly what it wants.”

“But if this ‘Witch’ is real, and she’s one of the original Primus,” Lena argued, “she might be the only one who knows how to control the Serpent’s Coil. She might have lived with its amplified effects for decades. She could hold the key to Thorne’s ‘Dampener Protocol,’ or have developed her own methods. Can we afford *not* to investigate, especially if Kora is already… attuned to her?”

The debate raged. The risks were astronomical. A small team venturing into the Fulminate Deeps would be cut off, vulnerable, facing environmental hazards that could destroy them before they even encountered this mysterious figure. And if the Crystal Witch was hostile, or an agent of the entity…

Yet, the alternative was to keep Kora locked away, a ticking time bomb, waiting for the entity to finally make its move on the enclave, or for the distant Epsilon-7 Cascade to somehow find its echo in her. The status quo was untenable.

“If a team goes,” Kaia said slowly, thinking aloud, “it has to be small, fast, and prepared for anything. Minimal electronic footprint to avoid triggering storms, relying on hardened systems and Mileo’s most shielded comms relays. We’d need a route that avoids the worst of the documented storm paths, if such a thing exists.”

Ryn was already mapping potential approaches, his expression doubtful. “The ‘safest’ routes are still incredibly hazardous, Kaia. And we have no idea what we’d be walking into once we got there.”

The most contentious point was Kora herself.
“I have to go,” Kora stated, her voice surprisingly firm over the comms. “If she’s real, if she’s like me… I’m the only one who might be able to approach her, to understand her. My Coil resonated with her call. That has to mean something.”

“It could also mean you’re a homing beacon leading us all into a trap, Kora,” Felix said, his tone harsh but laced with concern.

“Perhaps,” Kora admitted. “But if there’s a chance she can help me control this, help *us*… isn’t it a risk worth taking? What’s the alternative? I stay here, and we all live in fear of what I might become, or what the entity might do *through* me?”

Her words hung in the air. She was right. Their current situation was a slow siege, their options dwindling.

Kaia looked at her team, their faces etched with worry and exhaustion. The decision ultimately rested with her. Sending a team, potentially with Kora, into the Fulminate Deeps was a gamble of almost suicidal proportions. But the siren’s call of a potential solution, a way to understand and perhaps master the terrifying power of the Serpent’s Coil, was almost impossible to ignore.

“Ryn,” Kaia said, her voice resolute. “Map the least suicidal route into the Fulminate Deeps. Detail every known hazard, every potential shelter. Lena, work with Mileo. If we go, we need a way to monitor Kora’s Coil activity remotely, something more robust than the enclave-bound systems, and we need to know if that ‘Witch’s’ signal changes or intensifies. Felix, you and I will start prepping a stripped-down, hardened scout vehicle. We’ll need to be able to survive where even the crawler couldn’t.”

She hadn’t explicitly said Kora was going, but the implication was clear. If they went, Kora’s unique connection might be their only advantage.

“We’re not deciding to go yet,” Kaia added, seeing the deep concern on their faces. “We’re deciding to prepare for the *possibility*. We need more information. We need a plan that isn’t just wishful thinking.”

But as she spoke, a faint, almost imperceptible tremor ran through the enclave, a low hum that vibrated up from the bedrock. On Lena’s console, the graph depicting Kora’s Serpent’s Coil activity spiked erratically for a brief moment, then settled, but at a slightly higher, more agitated baseline.

The distant song from the Fulminate Deeps was growing stronger, and it felt like the decision was slowly being taken out of their hands.
