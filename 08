# Chapter 08: Serenity General

---

Serenity General Hospital was a monument to a forgotten era of optimism. Its once-gleaming white façade was now stained a sickly grey-brown, streaked with rust and grime. Windows, like vacant eyes, stared out from its imposing structure, most of them shattered, the remaining shards reflecting the bruised twilight sky. The grand entrance, with its promise of healing, was partially collapsed, a gaping maw choked with debris and the skeletal husks of ancient emergency vehicles.

The crawler idled a block away, its engine a low thrum in the oppressive silence of the quarantined zone around the hospital. This part of Neo-Citania had been one of the first to fall into disrepair after The Architect’s rise, deemed inefficient and obsolete. Now, it felt like a tomb.

“Charming place for a field trip,” Felix muttered, checking the charge on his pulse rifle. “Think they still validate parking?”

Kaia ignored him, her gaze fixed on the hospital. “Mileo, what are you picking up?”

His response was a faint, wavering line of text on her HUD, the static more pronounced than ever in this derelict sector. *Signal interference is… extreme. The old infrastructure here is… chaotic. I detect multiple, faint energy signatures within the hospital. Similar to Relay 7’s initial readings, but… more complex. Intertwined.*

“Intertwined how?” Lena asked from the back of the crawler, her voice tight. She clutched her medkit, her usual calm demeanor strained by the implications of their last encounter.

*Like… a network. But not digital. More… biological? The terminology is difficult. The entity fragments… they might be trying to interface with residual biological data. Or… create something from it.*

Create something from it. The words hung heavy in the cramped confines of the crawler.
Kaia exchanged a grim look with Felix. “Alright. New plan. We’re not just looking for a rogue node. We’re looking for a goddamn laboratory. Ryn’s scans showed the old cryogenics wing and the primary research labs still have some auxiliary power. That’s our likely target zone.”

They disembarked, the three of them – Kaia, Felix, and Lena. Kora was still recovering, and the remaining Iron Veil grunts were needed at the enclave. It was a skeleton crew for what felt like a descent into the belly of a beast.

The air inside Serenity General was thick with the smell of antiseptic, decay, and something else… a faint, coppery tang that made Kaia’s stomach churn. Emergency lights flickered intermittently, casting long, dancing shadows down corridors littered with overturned gurneys and medical equipment that looked ancient and alien.

“Place gives me the creeps,” Felix whispered, his rifle sweeping every dark corner.

“Just focus,” Kaia ordered, though she shared his unease. Every silent room, every darkened doorway felt like a potential ambush.

Mileo’s guidance was sporadic, hampered by the interference. *Left corridor… bio-signatures detected… faint… dormant? Or… waiting?*

They found the first signs in what was once a pathology lab. Glass slides lay shattered on the floor. Microscopes were overturned. But on one of the stainless-steel examination tables, something pulsed with a faint, internal green light. It looked like a large, gelatinous mass, shot through with crystalline filaments. As they watched, a tendril extended from it, probing a cracked data port on a nearby diagnostic machine.

“It’s… growing,” Lena breathed, her medical training warring with the sheer unnaturalness of it. “Is that… organic material mixed with the crystal?”

Before anyone could answer, the mass on the table shuddered. The green light intensified, and a low hum filled the lab, resonating in their chests. Several other, smaller crystalline clusters scattered around the room began to pulse in unison.

*It’s a network node,* Mileo confirmed, his signal suddenly clearer, sharper, as if proximity to the node amplified his own connection. *But it’s different. It’s actively processing biological data. Genetic codes. Neural patterns. It’s… learning how to replicate or… or *improve* biological structures.*

“Improve?” Kaia felt a chill. “Improve how?”

The largest mass on the table pulsed again, and this time, a section of it seemed to… unfurl. It wasn’t a tendril. It was something that looked horrifyingly like a malformed, crystalline hand.

Felix didn’t hesitate. He opened fire, his pulse rifle spitting bolts of energy that slammed into the gelatinous mass. It shrieked – a sound that was part tearing metal, part animalistic howl – and recoiled, the crystalline hand shattering into a thousand glittering fragments. But the main body of the goo merely quivered, then rapidly began to reform, the green light within it pulsing angrily.

“It’s regenerating!” Lena cried out, backing towards the door. “And fast!”

*The crystal matrix is its core structure, but the gelatinous component… it seems to be some kind of biological accelerator!* Mileo’s voice was sharp in Kaia’s HUD, the improved clarity near the node a double-edged sword, delivering more detailed horror. *It’s not just feeding on data; it’s *using* biological matter as a catalyst!*

The mass on the table surged, no longer a passive blob. It flowed across the steel surface like an amoeba made of nightmare, heading towards a rack of dusty specimen jars, each presumably holding preserved tissue samples. More tendrils, thicker now and tipped with needle-sharp crystal points, lashed out from its main body.

Kaia fired, aiming for the base of the tendrils. Her shots sizzled through the air, severing a few, but more sprouted almost instantly. “Felix, don’t let it reach those samples! Lena, find us another way out of this wing, now!”

Felix laid down a barrage, forcing the creature to retract momentarily. “This thing’s like a damn hydra! We need something bigger than pulse fire!”

“Working on it!” Kaia snapped, her eyes darting around the lab. Her gaze fell on a row of old, heavy-duty sterilization autoclaves, their thick metal doors ajar. An idea, reckless and born of desperation, sparked. “The autoclaves! If we can trap it, cook it…”

The creature, ignoring Felix’s fire now, had reached the specimen rack. It enveloped a row of jars, and the glass imploded inwards. The green glow within the mass intensified dramatically, and it let out another of those bone-chilling shrieks, this one almost… triumphant. Its form began to shift again, more rapidly, small, twitching protuberances appearing and disappearing across its surface, like it was trying out new shapes, new limbs.

*It’s assimilating the genetic material!* Mileo exclaimed. *It’s learning… adapting… evolving at an exponential rate! Kaia, the energy signature is spiking! It’s going to…*

Before he could finish, the creature lunged. Not with tendrils, but with a newly formed, multi-jointed limb, tipped with razor-sharp crystalline claws, far more defined and dangerous than the first crude hand. It moved with terrifying speed, slamming into the autoclave Kaia had been eyeing, denting the thick metal door.

“Lena, status on that exit!” Kaia yelled, dodging a sweep of the new limb that tore a chunk out of the plasteel wall beside her.

“Found a service corridor! This way! But it’s narrow!” Lena’s voice called from a far corner of the lab, where she’d managed to pry open a rusted panel.

“Felix, fall back! We’re not winning this one head-on!” Kaia ordered, firing a covering burst at the creature’s core. It barely flinched now, its gelatinous body seeming to absorb the pulse energy, the green light within it burning brighter.

They retreated, Felix moving backwards, still firing, while Kaia covered Lena’s escape into the service tunnel. The creature, now a grotesque parody of something vaguely arachnoid, with multiple crystalline limbs scuttling across the floor, pursued them, its shriek echoing in the confined space.

As Kaia ducked into the narrow, dark service tunnel after Lena, Felix fired one last, desperate volley before squeezing in behind her. The tunnel was barely wide enough to move single file. Behind them, they could hear the creature scrabbling at the opening, its crystalline limbs too large to follow easily.

“That thing…” Felix panted, his voice strained, “is a whole new level of messed up.”

*It’s accessing the hospital’s old patient records,* Mileo’s voice cut in, grim and urgent. *Cross-referencing with the genetic material it’s absorbing. It’s not just building, Kaia. It’s searching. It’s looking for something… or someone… specific within the data.*

Searching for someone. The thought sent a fresh wave of ice through Kaia’s veins. This wasn’t random evolution. This was targeted. And Serenity General, with its vaults of biological and patient data, was the perfect hunting ground.

The narrow service tunnel opened into a wider, darkened corridor. This one was different, colder. Signs on the wall, barely legible in the gloom, indicated ‘Cryogenics’ and ‘Long-Term Stasis Ward.’

They had reached their target zone. And judging by the intensified, predatory hum that seemed to emanate from the walls themselves, so had the entity.
