# Chapter 25: The Tomb of Epsilon

---

The darkness within Tunnel 7-C was absolute, a heavy, viscous black that swallowed the beams of their shoulder-mounted lights almost immediately. The air was cold and dead, carrying that faint, persistent metallic tang Kaia had noticed at the entrance, now overlaid with the cloying sweetness of decay and something else… something that reminded her faintly of ozone, or the air after a high-energy discharge.

“Ryn, Mileo, you getting any readings in here?” Kaia’s voice was a dry whisper in her helmet, the sound unnervingly loud in the oppressive silence.

*“Atmospheric composition is… anomalous, Kaia,”* Ryn replied, his voice tinny and strained, the signal struggling to penetrate the earth and ferrocrete. *“Trace elements of unknown particulates. Radiation levels are slightly elevated, but not critical – yet. Mileo is detecting faint, repeating energy signatures deeper in, but they’re heavily dampened.”*

*“…The dampening field… it’s characteristic of Old World… containment protocols for… highly unstable… energetic materials…”* Mileo’s fragmented voice added.

“Unstable energetic materials. Sounds delightful,” Felix muttered, his pulse rifle sweeping every shadow. The tunnel was rough-hewn, clearly older than the containment wall, its sides showing marks of primitive boring machines. It descended at a shallow angle, twisting unpredictably. Water, thick with unidentifiable sediment, pooled on the floor, making their footing treacherous.

After what felt like an eternity of cautious progress, the tunnel opened into a wider space – a crudely constructed airlock, its inner door a massive slab of lead-lined plasteel, bearing a faded, stenciled symbol: a triangle with a stylized lightning bolt inside it, underscored by the stark warning: **‘EPSILON CLEARANCE – LEVEL 7 AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED – EXTREME BIO-ENERGETIC HAZARD’**.

“Level 7 Authorization,” Kaia read. “That sounds… exclusive.”

“And ‘Extreme Bio-Energetic Hazard’ sounds like a party I’d rather skip,” Felix added. “Think Thorne’s Yggdrasil access codes will work on this, Ryn?”

*“Unlikely. This predates the Yggdrasil cylinder’s specific encryption. But the locking mechanism appears to be a standard Old World magnetic tumbler system. Kaia, your bypass kit might be effective. Be warned, though – breaching this door will fully expose you to whatever is on the other side. And those energy signatures Mileo detected are much stronger beyond this point.”*

Kaia nodded, already pulling out her kit. The lock was ancient, corroded, but the magnetic tumblers were robust. As she worked, the silence pressed in, broken only by the drip of water and the hum of their suit systems. The metallic, ozonic smell was stronger here.

With a heavy clunk, the tumblers disengaged. Kaia and Felix exchanged a look, then, bracing themselves, pulled the massive door open. It moved with a protesting groan of rusted hinges.

The air that billowed out was shockingly cold, carrying with it a visible, shimmering distortion, like heat haze, but icy. And the smell… it was stronger, sharper, making their eyes water even through their helmet visors.

Beyond the airlock lay not a lab or a bunker, but a vast, natural cavern, its ceiling lost in the oppressive darkness far above. The faint, repeating energy pulses Mileo had detected were stronger here, emanating from the cavern’s depths, accompanied by a low, almost sub-audible thrum that vibrated through the soles of their boots.

The source of the light, such as it was, was bizarre. Veins of a crystalline material, glowing with a faint, sickly green luminescence, snaked across the cavern walls and floor, pulsing in rhythm with the thrumming. They looked disturbingly organic, like luminous fungal growths, yet were clearly mineral.

“Gods above…” Felix breathed, his light beam struggling against the sheer scale of the place. “What *is* this?”

*“The crystal… it’s similar to the structures Thorne was experimenting with for Project Yggdrasil…”* Mileo’s voice was filled with a digital equivalent of awe and horror. *“…But this is… raw. Unrefined. And… seemingly alive. The energy signatures are off the scale. This entire cavern is saturated with them.”*

The cavern floor sloped downwards, leading towards the source of the thrumming and the densest concentration of the glowing green crystal. Scattered across the floor were the remnants of what looked like an Old World research outpost: rusted equipment, overturned tables, shattered data consoles – all caked in dust and draped with the luminous crystalline growths.

And bodies. Dozens of them.

They were clad in Old World environmental suits, similar to their own but bulkier, more primitive. Most were sprawled near equipment, or in huddled groups, as if seeking shelter. But they weren’t just skeletons. The crystalline growths had… incorporated them. Green-glowing veins snaked through their suits, erupting from helmets and joints, encasing them in shimmering, macabre cocoons. Some were frozen mid-stride, their forms contorted.

“Epsilon-7… it wasn’t a lab,” Kaia whispered, horrified. “It was a tomb.”

“And this is the ‘hazard’ they sealed in,” Felix said, his voice grim. “Looks like some kind of crystal plague.”

They moved cautiously deeper, their boots crunching on crystalline dust. The thrumming grew louder, resonating in their chests.
Near a cluster of particularly large crystalline formations, they found a makeshift command center – a ring of consoles, mostly smashed, but one still showed a faint flicker of life on its screen. And slumped before it, more encased in crystal than any other, was a figure in a slightly different, perhaps more authoritative-looking suit. A name tag was barely visible beneath a crystalline shard on its chest: ‘L.A. BECK – SITE SUPERVISOR’.

Liam Ansel Beck. The ‘Unknown’ from Thorne’s list. He hadn't disappeared. He’d been consumed.

*“Kaia… the console before Beck… it’s still drawing minimal power from the crystalline field itself,”* Ryn said, his voice hushed. *“If you can clear some of that growth, Mileo might be able to attempt a data extraction. It could hold his final logs, an explanation for… all this.”*

Kaia approached the entombed figure of Liam Beck. The crystalline growth around him pulsed with a brighter light, and the thrumming seemed to focus, almost… responding to her proximity. A wave of dizziness washed over her.

“Kaia, you okay?” Felix asked, noticing her sway.

“Fine,” she lied, shaking her head to clear it. “Just… the energy here is intense.” She carefully began to chip away at the crystalline webbing covering the console, her multitool struggling against its unnatural hardness.

As a section of the console screen became visible, flickering text appeared, too corrupted to read. But then, a single, clear image resolved itself: the serpent coiled around the leafless tree. Project Yggdrasil’s emblem. And beneath it, a repeating line of text:

**‘WARNING: CHIMERA RESONANCE CASCADE IMMINENT. CONTAINMENT PROTOCOL: EPSILON-7 FAILURE. ALL IS LOST. THE SERPENT DEVOURS ITSELF.’**

Before she could process the ominous message, a section of the cavern wall nearby, thick with the pulsing green crystal, began to bulge. Cracks appeared, not of breaking rock, but of something… shifting within the crystal itself. The thrumming intensified to a painful, deafening roar.

“Kaia!” Felix yelled, his rifle aimed at the bulging wall. “Something’s coming out!”

The crystal didn’t just break; it seemed to *birth* a figure – tall, vaguely humanoid, but composed entirely of the shimmering, green-glowing crystal, its form indistinct, its limbs ending in razor-sharp points. It had no discernible face, only a blinding point of light where a head should be. And it was moving towards them.

The tomb of Epsilon-7 was not as dead as they had thought.
