# Chapter 02: Frayed Edges

---

The Neo-Citania University campus was a graveyard of forgotten knowledge. Grand archways, once symbols of enlightenment, now stood like skeletal mouths choked with debris and invasive, mutated vines that pulsed with a faint, unhealthy luminescence. Lecture halls gaped open, their interiors gutted by scavengers or time, their tiered seating looking like rows of broken teeth. The air was heavy, carrying the scent of mildew, burnt electronics, and an undercurrent of something else… something metallic and sharp that prickled the back of Kaia’s throat.

“Mileo, you still with me?” Kaia kept her voice low, her pulse rifle sweeping the crumbling quad. Felix and two Iron Veil grunts, Jaxer and Kora, fanned out, their movements economical and tense. Lena trailed them, medkit ready.

A faint shimmer on her HUD. *Here. Signal’s stronger. But it’s… messy. Like a thousand broken transmissions all screaming at once. The network fabric is thin here, Kaia. Very thin. I’m having trouble getting a clear reading on… well, anything beyond the immediate vicinity.*

“Understood. Keep trying.” Thin network. That wasn’t good. It meant Mileo, their digital eyes and ears, was half-blind. It also meant whatever was causing this was actively disrupting the digital sphere.

They moved past a toppled statue of some long-dead university founder, its bronze face streaked with grime. The silence here was different from the city’s usual post-entity quiet. This was a charged silence, buzzing with unseen energy. Kaia’s hair felt like it was standing on end.

“Energy readings are erratic,” Felix reported, his own hand-held scanner sputtering. “Getting spikes all over the place. Nothing consistent.”

“That’s our ‘agitated’ energy,” Kaia muttered. “Source?”

*Deeper in,* Mileo’s impression came, accompanied by a faint directional arrow on her HUD pointing towards what looked like the ruins of the main library. *The signal… it’s pulling, Kaia. Like a drain.*

A drain. Hungry. The words echoed in her mind.

As they neared the library’s shattered entrance, a low hum vibrated through the soles of Kaia’s boots. It wasn’t the familiar thrum of Architect-tech or the deeper resonance of the entity. This was a raw, almost organic throb.

Suddenly, Jaxer cried out, stumbling back, his rifle clattering on the broken flagstones. “My systems! Something’s… draining my HUD!”

Kaia spun. Jaxer was clutching his helmet, his visor flickering wildly before going dark. Kora cursed, raising her weapon. “What the hell was that?”

“It’s the drain,” Kaia snapped. “Anything running on direct network interface is vulnerable. Switch to isolated power on your gear if you can. Lena, check him.”

Lena was already at Jaxer’s side, her movements quick. “Minor neural feedback. He’ll be disoriented. Looks like a targeted energy leech.”

*It’s adapting,* Mileo’s thought was sharp, laced with something akin to digital alarm. *It’s learning to feed off local tech.*

“Lovely,” Kaia gritted out. “So it’s not just hungry, it’s got table manners.” She looked at the gaping maw of the library. “That’s where we’re going. Felix, Kora, take point. Jaxer, you’re with Lena. Stay back unless we call you.”

The interior of the library was a disaster. Books, or what was left of them after years of neglect and moisture, were dissolving into mulch on the floor.Collapsed shelves formed precarious barricades. The air was colder here, and the humming was louder, accompanied by a faint, high-pitched whine that scraped at Kaia’s nerves.

*The signal core is below us,* Mileo indicated. *Old server rooms, I think. Pre-Architect data archives. That’s what it’s feeding on. Data. Energy. Anything it can get.*

“And it’s using the old systems as a… what? A nest?” Kaia murmured, stepping over a pile of scorched circuit boards.

The floor suddenly bucked. A section of shelving tore loose from the wall with a screech of tortured metal, crashing down where Felix had been moments before. He scrambled back, cursing.

“Hostile architecture?” Ryn would have quipped. Kaia didn’t feel like laughing.

“It knows we’re here,” Kora said, her voice tight.

*More than that,* Mileo projected. *It’s… reacting. The network is screaming.*

The humming intensified, and from the shadows between the towering, derelict server racks in the exposed basement below them, something began to coalesce. It wasn’t solid, not exactly. More like a localized distortion, a shimmering heat-haze of static and raw data, shot through with crackling blue energy. Tendrils of this… *thing*… snaked out, probing, latching onto exposed conduits and data ports in the ancient servers, which glowed briefly then died, drained.

“What in the fractured void is that?” Felix breathed, his rifle aimed, though what he was aiming *at* was debatable.

The distortion pulsed, and Kaia felt a wave of dizziness, a phantom pressure against her own neural interface, far more aggressive than the earlier drain on Jaxer. The whispers in her comm, usually a background annoyance, spiked into a cacophony of garbled voices, shouts, and screams.

*It’s a focal point!* Mileo’s transmission was strained, broken. *A… a raw data-construct! It’s trying to… to build something! Or call something!*

The shimmering mass pulsed again, larger this time, and one of its tendrils lashed out towards Kaia. She threw herself aside, the energy crackling past her, scorching the spot where she’d stood.

“Alright, ugly!” Kaia yelled, firing a three-round burst from her pulse rifle. The energy bolts hit the distortion, causing it to recoil and hiss, the sound like a thousand nails scraping across glass. “You want a fight? You got one!”

But as the thing writhed, its form seemed to solidify in places, taking on jagged, almost crystalline shapes before dissolving back into roiling static. It wasn’t just fighting back. It was learning from the impact, analyzing the energy of her weapon.

*It’s not just hungry,* Mileo’s voice was faint now, struggling against the interference. *It’s… evolving. Rapidly.*

The ground shook again, and more of the library floor groaned, threatening to give way. Below them, the data-construct pulsed, growing, feeding. And Kaia knew, with a cold certainty, that this was only the beginning of whatever nightmare was clawing its way out of Neo-Citania’s ruins.
