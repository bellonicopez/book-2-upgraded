# Chapter 05: The Old Relay

---

The first target on Ryn’s list was an old sub-network relay station in what was once designated Sector Delta-7, a crumbling industrial wasteland on the city’s forgotten western fringe. According to the pre-Architect schematics, Relay 7 was one of the original digital arteries of Neo-Citania, abandoned for decades when more efficient fiber lines were laid. Now, it was just a concrete carbuncle on a landscape of rust and ruin.

“Charming,” Felix muttered, peering through the crawler’s reinforced viewport as they navigated a street choked with skeletal remains of automated cargo haulers. “Real fixer-upper. Think it’s got good bones?”

Kaia didn’t grace him with a response. Her focus was on the faint, almost imperceptible tremor in her HUD where Mileo’s presence usually offered a steady stream of data. Now, it was like listening to a distant radio station through a wall of interference.

*Detecting… anomalous energy fluctuations ahead,* Mileo’s signal was weak, fragmented. *Localized. Consistent with… the university signature. But… quieter. More… insidious.*

“Insidious. Great,” Kaia said, more to herself than Felix. She’d brought a lean team: just Felix, his steady nerve and pulse rifle a comfort, and Jaxer. The Iron Veil grunt was still a bit jumpy after the university incident, but he was disciplined and, more importantly, available. Everyone else was either recovering or fortifying the enclave.

The crawler rumbled to a halt a few hundred meters from the relay station – a squat, windowless bunker half-swallowed by rust-colored weeds and creeping, phosphorescent moss. The air here tasted of decay and ozone.

“Alright, standard approach,” Kaia ordered as they disembarked, the silence of the sector pressing in. “Felix, you’re on point. Jaxer, watch our six. I’ll try and get Mileo a clearer signal once we’re closer.”

They moved through the desolate landscape, boots crunching on broken ferrocrete and something that looked suspiciously like dried, iridescent slime. The relay station’s main blast door was fused shut with rust and time.

“No subtle entry here,” Felix observed, examining the door. “Breaching charge?”

“Too loud,” Kaia decided. “Don’t want to announce our arrival if something *is* gestating in there. Look for an auxiliary access. Ventilation shafts, maintenance tunnels.”

It was Jaxer who found it – a corroded maintenance hatch hidden beneath a tangle of dead vines, barely wide enough for one person to squeeze through. Felix, after a moment’s work with a pry bar, managed to wrench it open with a groan of tortured metal.

“Ladies first?” he offered, gesturing into the darkness with a mock bow.

Kaia just gave him a look and slid into the narrow shaft, her rifle held tight. It was a tight squeeze, the air thick with the smell of damp earth and something else… a faint, sweet, cloying odor that made her nose wrinkle.

They emerged into a cramped maintenance corridor, lit only by the emergency strobes on their armor. The silence here was absolute, save for the drip-drip-drip of water from a leaky conduit somewhere nearby.

*Kaia… the signal… it’s stronger here,* Mileo’s voice was a little clearer, but still strained. *The main relay core is directly below this level. The energy patterns are… strange. Not aggressive like the university construct. More… systematic. Like it’s… building something. Carefully.*

“Building what?” Kaia whispered, her hand tightening on her rifle.

The corridor opened into a larger chamber. This must have been the primary control room for the relay. Consoles, coated in decades of dust, lined the walls. Most were dark, but one, directly in the center of the room, flickered with a faint, sickly green light.

And the source of the sweet smell was stronger here. Kaia’s gaze was drawn to the flickering console. Growing from its cracked casing, like some grotesque digital fungus, were crystalline structures. They pulsed with the same green light as the screen, intricate and delicate, but with an underlying sense of wrongness. Tiny filaments, almost too fine to see, snaked out from the crystals, burrowing into the surrounding consoles, into the floor, into the very walls of the relay station.

“What in the void…?” Felix breathed, taking a step closer.

“Don’t touch it!” Kaia snapped, her instincts screaming.

*It’s… organic? No… bio-digital,* Mileo struggled to articulate. *It’s integrating itself. Not just feeding on the data, Kaia. It’s… terraforming. Converting the old tech into a new kind of network. A living network.*

One of the larger crystals on the central console pulsed, and a section of the floor nearby rippled, the ferrocrete momentarily taking on the same crystalline texture before settling back.

Jaxer let out a choked gasp. “The walls… they’re *humming*.”

He was right. A low, almost sub-audible thrum filled the air, seeming to emanate from the crystalline growths. It wasn’t the chaotic energy of the university; this was controlled, rhythmic.

“This isn’t just a fragment taking root,” Kaia realized with dawning horror. “This is an infestation. A different *kind* of evolution.”

The central console flickered more intensely, and a new crystalline spire, slender and sharp as a needle, began to grow from its surface, reaching upwards like a searching antenna.

*It’s detected us,* Mileo warned. *It’s trying to… interface.*

Before Kaia could react, a dozen fine filaments shot out from the nearest crystalline mass on the wall, whipping towards Jaxer. He cried out, stumbling back, but two of the filaments found their mark, piercing his armored boot. He screamed, a raw, terrified sound, and collapsed, his body convulsing.

“Jaxer!” Felix yelled, raising his rifle.

“Don’t fire!” Kaia ordered, her mind racing. “If those things are connected to him…!”

The green light in Jaxer’s visor flickered erratically, then shifted to the same sickly green as the crystals. He went still, the convulsions stopping. Slowly, unnervingly, he began to get to his feet, his movements stiff, unnatural.

When he turned to face them, his visor was dark, but from behind it, Kaia could swear she saw a faint, internal green glow. And the rhythmic hum of the room seemed to resonate from him.

“Oh, you have got to be kidding me,” Felix whispered, his rifle still aimed.

Jaxer, or whatever was now wearing Jaxer’s armor, took a step towards them, its head tilted at an unnatural angle. It didn’t speak. It didn’t need to. The message was clear.

*It’s assimilated him,* Mileo’s voice was flat, devoid of its usual digital inflections, filled with something that sounded chillingly like despair. *It’s learning to use biological hosts.*

The fight for Neo-Citania had just taken a terrifying new turn.
