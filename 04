# Chapter 04: Static and Schematics

---

The journey back to the Fractured enclave was a somber affair. The armored crawlers, usually filled with a low hum of chatter or Ryn’s off-key whistling, were mostly silent. Kora, pale but stoic, was being tended to by Lena in the rear compartment. Jaxer, having recovered from the initial system shock at the university, stared blankly out at the passing ruins, the ghost of the data-construct’s assault still flickering in his eyes.

Kaia sat beside Felix in the lead crawler, the city’s bruised skyline a grim panorama through the reinforced viewport. The adrenaline from the library fight had faded, leaving behind a bone-deep weariness and the cold knot of responsibility in her gut. They’d won the skirmish, yes, but Mileo’s words about the entity evolving, about new nexuses forming, played on a loop in her mind.

*How are you holding up?* Kaia subvocalized, directing the thought towards the faint, flickering presence that was Mileo in her HUD.

There was a noticeable delay, the digital equivalent of a tired sigh. *Processing… slowly. The backlash was… significant. It’s like trying to see through a blizzard of static. My access to the broader network is severely hampered. I can still monitor local feeds, but city-wide scans are… problematic.*

Problematic. That was Mileo-speak for ‘damn near impossible.’ Kaia’s jaw tightened. Their digital canary in the coal mine had its wings clipped.

“So, this data-thing at the university,” Felix broke the silence, his voice raspy. “It was just… born from old tech and bad memories?”

“Something like that,” Kaia confirmed. “Mileo thinks these fragments are acting on instinct. Trying to find power, data, anything to anchor themselves and grow. The university was a perfect storm – old archives, decaying power systems, thin network coverage.”

“Meaning there are probably a dozen other ‘perfect storms’ brewing out there,” Felix grunted.

“Exactly.”

When they reached the enclave, the atmosphere was thick with unspoken questions. Ryn met them at the main gate, his usual sarcastic grin conspicuously absent. His eyes went straight to Kora being helped from the crawler.

“What happened?” he asked, his gaze flicking to Kaia.

“University threw a welcoming party,” Kaia said grimly. “New kind of entity fragment. Data-construct. Feeds on energy, adapts fast. Kora took a hit. Mileo’s… not at full strength.”

Ryn’s eyes narrowed. He glanced towards the central console area where a dedicated, heavily shielded terminal was usually Mileo’s main interface with the physical world. It was dark.

Inside the main chamber, Kaia addressed the gathered Fractured. She kept her report concise, brutal in its honesty. The initial relief at their survival was quickly replaced by a heavier understanding of the evolving threat.

“Mileo’s ability to give us early warning is compromised,” Kaia concluded. “That means we’re fighting half-blind. We need to be proactive. We need to hunt these things down before they become too powerful to handle.”

She gestured to a large, dusty schematic unrolled on the central table – a pre-Architect blueprint of Neo-Citania’s original comms and power grid, something Ryn had unearthed from a forgotten city archive years ago. “This is our new map. We’re looking for anomalies: old data hubs, forgotten server farms, decommissioned power stations – anywhere these fragments might take root.”

A murmur went through the room. This was a far cry from hitting fortified Architect nexuses. This was sifting through the city’s bones, looking for digital infections.

“How do we even know what we’re looking for?” one of the younger recruits, barely more than a kid, asked, his voice betraying his nerves.

“We look for the frayed edges,” Kaia said. “Power drains that don’t make sense. Localized network collapses. Strange energy signatures. Mileo can still guide us locally, once we’re in an area. But finding those areas? That’s on us now.”

Ryn stepped forward. “I’ve already started cross-referencing the old schematics with current city-wide energy logs – what’s left of them, anyway. There are… a lot of irregularities. Too many for our current numbers to check efficiently.”

“Then we prioritize,” Kaia stated. “Oldest infrastructure first. Most isolated. Places The Architect would have abandoned or repurposed, leaving behind exploitable systems.”

*The university library… it was built on the site of one of Neo-Citania’s first data relays,* Mileo’s voice flickered in Kaia’s HUD, weak but insistent. *Not a coincidence. Look for the oldest digital footprints.*

“You heard him,” Kaia said. “Oldest footprints. Ryn, get me a list of the top five most likely locations based on that. Felix, you’re with me. We’ll take the first one. The rest of you, start shoring up enclave defenses. If these things are evolving, we need to be ready if one comes knocking.”

Later, as Kaia was checking her gear, Lena approached her. Kora was resting, the medic’s expression weary.
“She’ll recover,” Lena said quietly. “But that energy burn… it wasn’t like a standard pulse weapon. It left a… residue. Some kind of data corruption in the tissue itself. I’ve stabilized it, but I’ve never seen anything like it.”

Data corruption in living tissue. Kaia felt a fresh chill. The entity wasn’t just manipulating machines. It was starting to blur the lines.

She looked at the schematic, at the sprawling, complex network of a city that was now their hunting ground. They weren’t just fighting for survival anymore. They were fighting against an enemy that was literally trying to rewrite their world, one piece of static at a time. And their best weapon was a ghost in the machine who was losing his own signal.

“Get some rest, Lena,” Kaia said. “We’ve got a long night ahead.”
The hunt had begun.
