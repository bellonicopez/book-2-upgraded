# Chapter 46: The Cosmic Report

---

The revelation that the Watchers were broadcasting their observations to a distant point in the Cygnus constellation sent a profound chill through the enclave. The abstract threat of alien observation had suddenly become more concrete: they were being assessed, and a report was being filed. By whom, and for what ultimate purpose, remained terrifyingly unknown.

“Cygnus X-1 is in that direction,” Ryn murmured, his face pale as he stared at the stellar chart overlaid with the broadcast trajectory. “A black hole with a massive companion star. A common subject of pre-Collapse deep space radio astronomy. But this… this isn’t a radio wave. The carrier signal is something I can’t even categorize. It’s like trying to describe color to a man born blind.”

Lena, ever pragmatic, began working with Ryn to analyze the faint, embedded patterns within the Watcher’s broadcast. “If it’s a report, there might be structure, repetition, something we can eventually decipher, even if we don’t understand the ‘language’ itself. It’s a long shot, but it’s better than sitting in the dark.”

Felix, meanwhile, ramped up defensive drills. “Assume the worst,” he told his teams. “Assume that report says ‘Class Five planet, ripe for the picking,’ or ‘Primitive vermin, sterilize at your convenience.’ We can’t fight what’s out there, but we can make ourselves the hardest damn nut to crack on this planet.”

Amidst this heightened anxiety, Kora felt an almost desperate urge to continue her work with the Cascade energies. Her small success with the obsidian field was a fragile counterpoint to the cosmic scale of the Watchers’ presence. If humanity, or even just their small enclave, was to have any agency in this new, unfolding galactic drama, it would likely stem from understanding and influencing the very planetary forces that had attracted the Watchers’ attention.

She chose her next target carefully: a smaller, more volatile Cascade pocket that had recently appeared in the blighted industrial ruins east of the enclave. This one pulsed with erratic bursts of energy, spitting out small, superheated crystalline fragments. It was a clear and present danger to any scavenging parties.

“This is different from the obsidian field,” Kora explained to Kaia as they observed it from a safe distance. “That was a large, consolidated mass, influenced by the entity. This is… raw, unstable, like an open wound in the planet’s energy field.”

Applying Solara’s guidance – *“Listen… gently guide… do not force”* – Kora approached the volatile pocket. The air thrummed with chaotic energy. She extended her senses, wincing as the jarring, dissonant frequencies assaulted her. It took considerable effort to find the underlying terrestrial song beneath the painful static.

Slowly, patiently, she began her work. She didn’t try to silence the energy, but to soothe its wildness, offering a harmonizing rhythm, a melodic counter-narrative to its chaotic expressions. It was like trying to calm a panicked animal, requiring immense empathy and unwavering focus. The Watcher in orbit, Ryn confirmed, had once again shifted its primary sensors to her location, its silent, analytical gaze fixed upon her.

Hours passed. The erratic energy bursts from the Cascade pocket gradually lessened. The spitting of superheated fragments ceased. A steady, rhythmic pulse began to emanate from the area, the chaotic energies coalescing into a more stable, albeit still intensely powerful, form. Kora didn't try to change its fundamental nature, only to ease its uncontrolled agitation.

As she worked, their primary terrestrial entity made its presence known. Not with a direct assault, but with a subtle, targeted interference. Kora felt its dissonant tendrils trying to disrupt her concentration, to inject fear and doubt into her mind, to break the delicate harmony she was establishing with the Cascade pocket. It was a battle of wills fought on a psychic plane, even as she physically interacted with the energies before her.

“It’s trying to distract me,” Kora gritted out, her brow furrowed in concentration, sweat beading on her temples. “It doesn’t want me to learn this.”

This time, however, something new happened. Lena’s “mental armor” project, still in its early stages, provided a small but crucial defense. Before Kora had ventured out, Lena had given her a small, experimental device that emitted a personalized sequence of subliminal auditory and haptic pulses, designed by Mileo based on Kora’s own brainwave patterns during moments of peak focus. It wasn’t a shield, but an aid to concentration, a way to help her maintain her internal anchor against the entity’s insidious whispers.

And it helped. The entity’s interference was still there, a nagging pressure, but Kora found it easier to push it to the periphery of her awareness, to maintain the core of her harmonic focus.

By the time dusk began to settle, the eastern Cascade pocket was no longer a raging wound, but a pocket of intense, stable, pulsing energy. It was still wild, still powerful, but no longer mindlessly destructive. Kora had, in essence, helped it find a more coherent song.

As she withdrew, exhausted but with a sense of growing mastery, Ryn reported from the ops chamber. “The Watcher’s broadcast to Cygnus has… paused. It happened the moment you stabilized that eastern pocket. It’s still observing you, Kora, but the outbound signal has stopped, at least for now.”

A ripple of speculation went through the ops team. Had Kora’s success been significant enough to warrant an addendum to the Watcher’s report? Or was it merely a coincidence?

Before they could delve deeper, another alert flashed. This one was from one of Felix’s long-range perimeter patrols, far to the north.
“Unidentified ground contact,” the patrol leader’s tense voice crackled. “Large. Biological, we think. Moving fast. Doesn’t match any known mutated fauna. And… it’s glowing. Faintly. Like those Cascade crystals Kora’s been calming.”

The planet, it seemed, was not content to let the Watchers or the entity monopolize their attention. Its own chaotic awakening was continuing to produce new, unpredictable phenomena. The dissonant chorus had just gained another, unknown voice.
