# Chapter 23: The Epsilon Variable

---

Days blurred into a monotonous cycle of heightened alert and frustrating dead ends. Kora remained in her gilded cage, the weight of her lineage a constant, silent companion. Lena and Mileo continued their deep dive into the Serpent’s Coil, their progress slow and painstaking, like mapping a continent with a magnifying glass. The entity remained quiet, a terrifying, unseen predator whose silence was almost as unnerving as an open attack.

Ryn, however, was a man possessed. Fueled by nutrient paste and an obsessive refusal to give up, he’d burrowed deeper into the digital ruins of the Old World than ever before. He’d set up complex search algorithms, cross-referencing the Lineage Primus names with every fragmented data log, every snippet of corrupted newsfeed, every ghost of a personnel file he could unearth. He was looking for needles in a universe of haystacks.

Late one cycle, when the rest of the enclave was in its deepest period of rest, Kaia found him hunched over his console, his face illuminated by a single, flickering holographic display. He looked exhausted, but his eyes held a spark she hadn’t seen in days.

“You found something,” she stated, not a question.

Ryn nodded slowly, gesturing to the display. It showed a heavily corrupted architectural schematic, barely legible. Superimposed were faint, almost invisible lines of text. “I was going through decommissioned city planning archives from Old Sector 5 – a district that was largely demolished and rebuilt just before The Architect’s rise. Standard urban renewal stuff. But I found an anomaly.”

He zoomed in on a specific section of the schematic. “This area was slated for a new commercial arcology. Standard procedure: survey, demolish, rebuild. But buried in the deepest layers of the annotation logs, I found references to a ‘Hazardous Material Abatement Protocol – Level Epsilon’.”

“Epsilon?” Kaia’s attention sharpened. “Like Epsilon-7?”

“Exactly. The protocol was initiated, then abruptly… canceled. The entire arcology project for this specific sub-sector was rerouted, the area declared ‘geologically unstable’ – a flimsy excuse, given the bedrock here. No demolition occurred. The existing structures were just… sealed off. Walled in during the subsequent redevelopment of the surrounding zones.”

He pulled up another file: a list of utility shut-off orders for that sealed-off sub-sector. Water, power, comms – all severed within a tight 24-hour window, roughly corresponding to the period when Lineage Primus members Aris Thorne-Vance, Samira El-Masri, and Chloe Anne Webster had their public records terminated.

“And then,” Ryn said, his voice dropping, “I found this.” He highlighted one of the faint lines of text on the schematic. It was a work order note, barely more than a digital scribble: *‘Sub-level access tunnel 7-C: Seal integrity compromised during Epsilon clearance. Recommend immediate perma-seal and backfill. Attn: Warden L.A.B.’*”

“Warden L.A.B.?” Kaia frowned. “Not *the* Warden from Serenity General?”

“Unlikely,” Ryn said. “The timeline is too early for that Warden’s known activation period according to Mileo’s Serenity data. And ‘Warden’ was a common Old World security or site management title. But ‘L.A.B.’…” He looked at Kaia. “Liam Ansel Beck. The Lineage Primus subject whose status was ‘Unknown Post-Epsilon-7’.”

A jolt went through Kaia. “You think Liam Beck was… a warden? Involved in this Epsilon clearance?”

“It’s a stretch,” Ryn admitted. “But the initials, the timing, the context of ‘Epsilon clearance’… What if Epsilon-7 wasn’t an incident, but a *place*? Or a codename for this sealed-off sub-sector in Old Sector 5? What if Liam Beck wasn’t just a subject, but had some role, however minor, in its operation or subsequent containment?”

It was a fragile thread, woven from digital ghosts and coincidences. But it was the first tangible lead they’d had.

“If this sub-sector was sealed because of a hazardous material situation related to Epsilon… and Lineage Primus subjects were involved…” Kaia mused, the implications clicking into place. “What kind of hazard are we talking about? Something connected to Project Yggdrasil? To the crystalline tech?”

“Possibly,” Ryn said. “The fact that they didn’t demolish it, but sealed it, suggests they wanted to contain something, not obliterate it. Or maybe they couldn’t obliterate it.”

*“…Kaia… Ryn…”* Mileo’s voice, weak but insistent, came from the speaker. He’d evidently been monitoring their conversation. *“…The designation ‘Epsilon-7’ also appears in one heavily encrypted fragment from Dr. Thorne’s Yggdrasil notes. It’s referenced as a… ‘contingency relocation site’ for critical Yggdrasil assets in the event of catastrophic failure at Pinnacle Genetics.”*

A contingency site. For critical assets. Like Lineage Primus subjects.

“So, Epsilon-7 could be a hidden lab, a bunker, where Thorne planned to continue his work, or at least safeguard his most valuable subjects, if Pinnacle went down,” Kaia pieced it together. “And Liam Beck might have been there, perhaps in a different capacity than just a test subject.”

“If it’s still sealed,” Ryn said, pulling up a modern map of Neo-Citania and overlaying the Old Sector 5 schematics, “it would be deep within the most heavily blighted, structurally unsound part of the old city. The ‘No-Go Zone’s No-Go Zone.’ Getting there would be incredibly dangerous.”

Kaia looked at the map. The area Ryn indicated was a nightmarish tangle of collapsed skyscrapers and toxic sumps, a place even the Iron Veil scavengers avoided. But if it held answers about Lineage Primus, about what happened to them, or even, however unlikely, if Liam Beck or his legacy survived there…

“If there’s even a chance Liam Beck, or records pertaining to him and the other ‘Active Epsilon-7’ subjects are there, we have to investigate,” Kaia said. “Kora’s life, and potentially the fate of the entire enclave, could depend on what we find. Or what we stop the entity from finding.”

The entity was hunting for Lineage Primus. If a hidden site existed that was crucial to their history, the entity would eventually find its way there too, guided by its own relentless, inscrutable logic.

“This won’t be like Pinnacle Genetics,” Felix, who had quietly entered the operations chamber, drawn by their hushed, intense conversation, chimed in. He looked at the map, his expression grim. “That place will be a deathtrap. And if it was sealed for a reason…”

“Then we go prepared for the worst,” Kaia said, her gaze hardening. “Ryn, can you pinpoint the exact location of that ‘Sub-level access tunnel 7-C’?”

Ryn nodded, already working. “I can give you coordinates. But Kaia… what if the ‘hazard’ is still active?”

Kaia looked at the image of the serpent coiled around the tree, still faintly visible on a dormant section of the display. “Then we face it. We’re done waiting for the ghosts of the Old World to come to us. It’s time we hunted them.”
