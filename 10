# Chapter 10: The White Bloom

---

The hiss of the stasis pod opening cut through the thrumming tension of the cryo-chamber like a blade. All movement ceased. The crystalline drones, moments before a relentless, flowing tide of pale flesh and green light, froze mid-stride, their featureless faces angled towards the source of the brilliant white illumination. Even the central spire, the heart of the entity’s network in this frozen mausoleum, pulsed erratically, its rhythmic green light faltering as if in digital shock.

Kaia, Felix, and Lena stared, forgetting for a moment their own desperate fight. The pod, one of the many ringing the central spire, was now fully open, bathing the immediate area in a light so pure it almost hurt to look at.

A figure stepped out.

It was tall, slender, and clad in a form-fitting, silvery suit that seemed to shimmer, untouched by the decades of decay that plagued everything else in Serenity General. Their features were sharp, androgynous, and their eyes, when they finally focused, were the color of glacial ice, holding an intelligence that felt ancient and startlingly alert. There was no frost on them, no sign of the long sleep they had just endured. They moved with a deliberate grace, stepping onto the frosted floor as if they’d only been asleep for a night.

The figure’s gaze swept across the chamber, taking in the crystalline drones, the pulsating green spire, and finally, Kaia’s small, battered team. There was no fear in those icy eyes, only a cool, appraising curiosity.

*Subject designation: Unknown,* Mileo’s voice crackled in Kaia’s HUD, a rare note of pure surprise in his digital tone. *No biological readings match any known database. The stasis pod… its internal chronometer indicates it was activated over two centuries ago, pre-dating even the earliest city records Ryn has.*

Two centuries. This person, this… relic… was from a time before Neo-Citania was even a blueprint.

The central spire pulsed violently, a deep, angry green. The crystalline drones stirred, their attention shifting from Kaia’s team to the newcomer. It was clear the entity perceived this new arrival as a threat, or at least, an unacceptable anomaly.

The figure in silver raised a hand, palm open, towards the nearest drone, which had begun to advance, its crystalline claws extended. Before the drone could strike, a beam of pure white light, almost too fast to see, lanced from the figure’s palm. It struck the drone dead center.

There was no explosion, no shattering of crystal. The drone simply… dissolved. Reduced to a cloud of drifting, inert dust in less than a second, the green light within it extinguished utterly.

Felix let out a low whistle. “Okay. *That’s* new.”

The other drones recoiled, a visible wave of hesitation passing through their ranks. The figure in silver didn’t press an attack, merely stood there, their hand still slightly raised, a silent, potent challenge.

“Who… what are you?” Kaia found her voice, shouting across the chamber.

The figure’s glacial eyes turned to her. When they spoke, their voice was calm, melodic, with an accent Kaia couldn’t place, resonating slightly in the cold air. “I am designated Warden. This facility is under my protection. These… constructs… are a violation.”

Warden. Protection. The words hung in the air.

The central spire pulsed again, faster now, and the remaining drones surged forward, not just towards the Warden, but also fanning out, trying to encircle both the newcomer and Kaia’s team. The entity was adapting, treating them all as hostile elements.

“Looks like the welcoming committee isn’t too happy about your wake-up call, Warden!” Kaia yelled, firing a burst at a drone menacing Lena. The pulse bolt, unlike the Warden’s light, only made the drone stagger and begin to regenerate.

The Warden moved then, with a speed that was startling. They flowed between the stasis pods, their silver suit a blur. Each time they extended a hand, another drone dissolved into dust. They weren’t just fighting; they were eradicating the entity’s presence with an efficiency that was breathtaking.

*Kaia, the Warden’s energy signature… it’s not technological in any way I recognize,* Mileo reported, his digital voice filled with awe and confusion. *It’s… organic? But amplified, controlled… I’ve never encountered anything like it.*

“Less analysis, more help!” Felix grunted, as two drones bore down on him. He managed to shatter one with concentrated fire, but the other was reforming rapidly.

The Warden, without looking, extended a hand backwards. A beam of white light shot past their shoulder, vaporizing the drone threatening Felix.

“Thanks for the assist!” Felix called out, looking genuinely impressed.

Kaia saw their chance. The drones were focused on the Warden, their coordinated attacks broken. The central spire was still the main threat, the source of the regeneration. “Felix, Lena, with me! We hit that spire while it’s distracted!”

They broke from their cover, charging towards the pulsating green heart of the entity’s network. The Warden, meanwhile, was a whirlwind of white light, effortlessly dismantling drone after drone, clearing a path for them whether intentionally or not.

As they neared the spire, crystalline tendrils lashed out from its base, trying to ensnare them. Kaia dodged, firing into the thickest part of the crystal. The spire shuddered, and the green light flickered.

*It’s vulnerable!* Mileo urged. *Its processing power is divided between controlling the remaining drones and… analyzing the Warden!*

Felix planted a breaching charge on the side of the spire, just as he had at Relay 7. “This is becoming a habit! Clear!”

They scrambled back as the charge detonated. The explosion rocked the chamber, sending shards of glowing green crystal flying. The spire cracked, buckled, and with a final, dying groan, its light extinguished.

Instantly, the remaining crystalline drones collapsed, their forms dissolving into heaps of inert dust and pale flesh, their connection severed. The oppressive hum of the entity’s network vanished, replaced by the much fainter, older hum of the cryo-facility’s own struggling machinery.

Silence descended, broken only by their ragged breathing and the soft hiss of venting cryo-gases.

The Warden stood in the center of the chamber, their silver suit pristine, their expression unreadable as they surveyed the damage. Their gaze fell on the ruined spire, then on Kaia’s team.

“The primary infestation has been neutralized,” the Warden stated, their voice echoing slightly in the sudden quiet. “Secondary protocols will now engage. This facility must be purged of all remaining contaminants.”

“Contaminants?” Kaia asked, wary. “You mean the entity?”

The Warden’s ice-blue eyes fixed on her. “All unauthorized biological and technological signatures. Including yours.”

Felix groaned. “Oh, for crying out loud. Can’t we just catch a break?”

The figure in silver took a step towards them, their hand beginning to glow with that same, terrifying white light. They had saved them from the entity, only to become a new, potentially far more dangerous, threat.
