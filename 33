# Chapter 33: The Thrumming Heart

---

The foothills of the Fulminate range were a prelude to a nightmare. The ground was a tortured landscape of blackened, glassy rock and razor-edged crystal shards that crunched under the Warthog’s treads. The air itself seemed to vibrate, a constant, low thrumming that resonated deep in their chests, accompanied by the persistent, sweet-metallic scent that Kora now intrinsically linked with raw, volatile power.

“All non-essential systems are offline,” Felix announced, his voice tight. “The ambient energy fields here are scrambling everything. Even the hardened compass is spinning uselessly. We’re navigating blind if Kora can’t lead us.”

Kaia glanced at Kora in the rear compartment. The young medic was pale, her eyes closed, her brow furrowed in concentration. The bio-monitor on her wrist pulsed with a steady, rapid rhythm. “Kora?”

Kora opened her eyes. They seemed darker, her pupils dilated, reflecting the violent hues of the sky visible through the Warthog’s reinforced viewport. “It’s… stronger here. The call. The vision of the spires… it’s like a beacon. I can feel the direction. Straight ahead, into that ravine.” She pointed towards a narrow, ominous cleft in the mountainside, where the air shimmered with visible heat and distortion.

“Charming,” Felix muttered, but Kaia nodded. “Take us in, Kora.”

The Warthog crawled into the ravine. The thrumming intensified, becoming a palpable force that vibrated through their bodies. The walls of the ravine were lined with immense, naturally formed Fulminite crystals, some glowing with an internal, sickly green light, others a deep, pulsating violet. They were raw, untamed, and radiated a dizzying energy that made their teeth ache.

“Ryn’s data mentioned these formations can discharge spontaneously,” Kaia warned, her hand near the Warthog’s emergency power cut-off. “If one of these big ones goes…”

As they ventured deeper, the landscape grew increasingly alien. The sky above was a perpetual twilight, lit by the eerie glow of the crystal formations and distant, silent flashes of lightning that arced between the mountain peaks. Strange, twisted flora, more mineral than vegetable, clung to the rocks, their crystalline leaves sharp as obsidian. There was no sign of animal life – not even insects. The only sound was the Warthog’s laboring engine and the omnipresent, deafening thrum.

Kora guided them with a certainty that belied the chaos around them. “Left at the twin violet pillars… Now, through that arch of glowing green… The white light I saw in my vision, it’s… it’s like a lighthouse, pulling me.” Her headaches were a raging inferno, but her voice was surprisingly steady, her focus absolute. The Serpent’s Coil, once a source of terror, was now her compass in this alien hellscape.

Suddenly, Felix slammed on the brakes. “Whoa! What in the blighted wastes is *that*?”

Ahead of them, the ravine opened into a vast, bowl-shaped valley. And in its center, rising from a field of shattered black glass that glittered like a million broken mirrors, was a structure that could not possibly be natural.

It was a spire, but not one of rock. It appeared to be a single, impossibly large crystal, easily three hundred meters tall, tapering to a needle-sharp point that seemed to pierce the bruised sky. It was a milky, opaque white, and it pulsed with a soft, internal luminescence – the brilliant white light from Kora’s visions. Around its base, smaller, similar white crystal spires were arranged in a deliberate, almost defensive circle.

The thrumming in the valley was different, more focused, almost… harmonious, centered on the great white spire. The chaotic energy of the outer Deeps seemed to be held at bay here, as if by the spire’s influence.

“That’s… not on any geological survey,” Kaia breathed, her voice filled with awe and trepidation. “That was *made*.”

“Or grown,” Felix corrected, his eyes wide. “The Crystal Witch’s handiwork?”

Kora stared, mesmerized. “The light… it’s her. I know it is. The call is coming directly from that spire.” She felt an overwhelming urge to leave the Warthog, to walk towards it.

Before anyone could react further, a section of the black glass field near the base of the central spire shimmered. The ground itself seemed to flow like liquid for a moment, then solidified into a figure.

It was tall and slender, clad in what looked like form-fitting, dull grey material that blended seamlessly with the environment. Its face was obscured by a smooth, reflective visor that mirrored the violent sky. It carried no visible weapon, but its posture was one of absolute stillness and control. It stood silently, watching them.

“Company,” Felix grunted, his hand instinctively reaching for the Warthog’s external defense controls, though he knew they were likely useless here.

The figure raised a hand, palm open, in a gesture that could have been a greeting or a warning. Then, a voice, clear and resonant, echoed not through their comms, but directly in their minds – a form of telepathic communication Kaia had only read about in Thorne’s most outlandish Yggdrasil theories.

*<<You have come far, Children of the Echo. The Singer is welcome. Her companions… are tolerated.>>*

The voice was female, ageless, and imbued with an undeniable power that sent shivers down Kaia’s spine. Kora gasped, her hand flying to her head. “I hear her… in my mind.”

The figure gestured towards the central white spire.
*<<The path is open. The First Song awaits the New. Approach, and be judged.>>*

The ground between them and the spire shimmered again, and a narrow pathway of smooth, white crystal, like a bridge, solidified across the treacherous field of black glass, leading directly to the base of the great spire.

Kaia looked at Felix, then at Kora. They were at the heart of the mystery, the Crystal Witch’s domain. The invitation – or summons – had been issued. There was no turning back now.

“Looks like we’re expected,” Kaia said, her voice grim. She unbuckled her harness. “Let’s not keep the lady waiting.”
