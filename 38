# Chapter 38: The Warding Song

---

The days following their return from the Fulminate Deeps were filled with a cautious, focused energy. Kora became the fulcrum around which the enclave’s new defense strategy revolved. Ryn and Lena worked tirelessly with her, devising ways to understand and quantify her abilities. They set up specialized sensors around the enclave’s perimeter, calibrated by Mileo to detect the subtle shifts in ambient energy that Kora could now perceive and influence.

“Think of it as… harmonic reinforcement,” Kora tried to explain to a skeptical Felix, who was overseeing the retrofitting of perimeter defenses to be less reliant on volatile electronics. “When I sense a dissonant energy signature – like a precursor to a seismic shock or a localized energy surge – I can try to project a counter-resonance, a stable frequency. It doesn’t eliminate the threat, but it can… lessen its impact, like tuning a string to prevent it from snapping under tension.”

Her primary focus, however, was the entity. Guided by Lena and Ryn, Kora began practicing extending her “warding song,” as Ryn had termed it. She would sit in the operations chamber, or sometimes atop the enclave’s highest observation deck, and consciously project her newfound harmony outwards, attempting to create a "bubble" of stable resonance that encompassed the entire settlement. It was mentally exhausting, requiring immense concentration, but with each attempt, her range and the stability of her projection grew.

*“The enclave’s overall energetic signature is becoming… quieter, more coherent,”* Mileo observed after several days of Kora’s practice. *“Ambient dissonances within our perimeter are measurably reduced. It is as if a subtle, protective field is being established.”*

This new defense was put to the test sooner than they anticipated. One evening, as a sickly green twilight settled over the blighted city, the enclave’s new perimeter sensors screamed a silent alarm directly to Ryn’s console. Simultaneously, Kora, who had been resting in her quarters, sat bolt upright, a cold dread washing over her.

“It’s here,” she breathed, her voice relayed through the comms to the ops chamber where Kaia and Lena were on duty. “The entity. It’s… probing.”

On the main display, Ryn highlighted a section of the outer perimeter near the old, sealed mag-lev tunnels. There was no visible intruder, no physical breach, but the energy readings were chaotic, fluctuating wildly. A wave of intense psychic pressure, like a silent scream, washed over the enclave, causing a momentary wave of nausea and disorientation among the inhabitants. Lights flickered, and sensitive equipment sparked.

“Kora, can you pinpoint it?” Kaia’s voice was tense.

“It’s not a physical presence, not yet,” Kora said, already moving towards the operations chamber. “It’s a wave of pure dissonance, trying to find a crack in our… our harmony. It’s testing the wards.”

Reaching the ops chamber, Kora closed her eyes, her hands outstretched as if physically pushing against an unseen force. The air around her seemed to shimmer. She focused her will, her entire being, on projecting her stable, harmonized resonance towards the source of the psychic assault. It was like leaning into a hurricane, the entity’s malevolent energy a cacophony of rage and hunger pressing against her mental shields.

This was no mere tremor, no localized energy surge. This was a direct, intelligent, and hostile force.

The lights in the ops chamber stabilized. The feeling of nausea receded. Ryn, his face pale, reported, “The energy fluctuations at the perimeter are… lessening. The psychic pressure is dropping.”

Kora was trembling, sweat beading on her forehead, but her expression was resolute. “It’s… it’s like a focused beam of pure negativity. I can counter it, but it’s strong. It’s learning.”

Then, a new alert flashed on Ryn’s console. “Multiple energy signatures flaring up *outside* Kora’s current warding radius!” he announced. “West quadrant, near the old industrial ruins. It’s like… the Cascade. Localized, intense bursts of crystalline energy.”

Kaia swore under her breath. “A distraction? Or is it trying to overwhelm her by attacking on multiple fronts?”

“It’s trying to make the environment itself hostile, to amplify the existing chaos beyond what I can easily soothe,” Kora realized. The entity wasn’t just attacking them directly; it was attempting to agitate the unstable energies of the surrounding ruins, turning the very land against them. Solara’s warning about the Cascade spreading, about other resonances stirring, echoed in her mind.

“Felix, get your teams to reinforce the West wall defenses, physical measures only!” Kaia commanded. “Lena, monitor Kora. If her vitals drop, we pull her back.”

Kora knew she couldn’t maintain a tight ward around the enclave *and* actively counter the entity’s direct probe *and* try to soothe the agitated Cascade energies flaring up further out. She had to choose.

“I have to focus on the direct assault first,” Kora decided, her voice strained. “The psychic probe. It’s the most immediate threat to everyone inside. The Cascade bursts… they’re further out. They’ll damage the ruins, maybe shake us, but the mental attack is insidious.”

For what felt like an eternity, Kora stood as a bulwark against the unseen tide. The entity’s pressure was relentless, shifting, seeking any weakness in her projected harmony. She could feel its cold, alien intelligence, its profound hunger. It was a battle of wills, fought on a plane of existence few could even perceive.

Finally, with a last, vicious surge that made Kora cry out and stumble, the psychic pressure receded, like a malevolent wave breaking and pulling back into the deep. The chaotic energy signatures at the perimeter vanished.

Ryn let out a shaky breath. “It’s gone. The probe has withdrawn.”

Kora sagged against a console, exhausted but triumphant. “It will be back. It knows we can resist now. It will adapt.”

The immediate crisis had passed, but the secondary one remained. The Cascade energy bursts in the western ruins continued to flare, though Ryn reported they weren’t spreading closer, for now.

“It seems the entity’s influence was needed to truly ignite them,” Lena theorized. “Without its focused dissonance, they’re just… unstable pockets.”

Kora, though drained, knew this was a crucial learning moment. “I need to understand those Cascade bursts. If the entity can use them, I need to learn how to calm them, or at least predict them.”

The enclave was safe, for now. Kora’s warding song had held, but the battle was far from over. The entity was a persistent, intelligent foe, and the world itself was becoming an increasingly unstable battleground. Kora’s journey of understanding her power, and the responsibility that came with it, had just entered a new, more dangerous phase.
