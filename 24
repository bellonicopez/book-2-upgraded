# Chapter 24: Into the Dead Zone

---

The decision to venture into the sealed sub-sector of Old Sector 5, the suspected location of Epsilon-7, cast a grim pall over the enclave. This wasn’t just a derelict ruin like Pinnacle Genetics; it was a place deliberately entombed, a wound in the city’s fabric that the Old World had tried to cauterize and forget. The very act of breaching it felt like tempting a fate that had lain dormant for centuries.

Preparations were meticulous and somber. Kaia and Felix were designated as the primary insertion team. Their combat suits were reinforced with extra ablative plating, their environmental systems triple-checked. They carried upgraded pulse rifles, seismic charges for breaching, and a suite of atmospheric sensors and biohazard detectors that chirped with nervous anticipation. Ryn, despite his desire to go, was deemed too valuable – and too vulnerable – for such an overtly hostile environment. He, along with the still-recovering Mileo, would provide remote support, guiding them through the labyrinthine ruins and attempting to interface with any systems they might find.

Kora watched them prepare, her expression a mixture of fear and a strange, unsettling resolve. She had insisted on personally checking their medical kits, her hands moving with a precision that belied the turmoil within her. “If this Liam Beck… if he was like my grandmother…” she’d said to Kaia, “if he knew something that could help… Be careful. Both of you.”

The journey to Old Sector 5 was a descent into Neo-Citania’s deepest scars. They used the same scout crawler, its engine now tuned for near-silent running, its hull bearing fresh scorch marks from their escape from the Ashfall District. The further they ventured from the enclave’s relative stability, the more oppressive the city became. Buildings leaned at impossible angles, their skeletal frames groaning under the weight of ages. The air grew thick with chemical fogs and the stench of ancient decay. Mutated creatures, larger and more grotesque than the usual sewer rats, skittered in the shadows, their eyes glowing with feral hunger.

“Charming neighborhood,” Felix quipped, his voice tight over the comms, his grip white-knuckled on the crawler’s pulse cannon controls. “Reminds me of my last vacation spot. Though the service here is probably worse.”

Kaia didn’t reply, her gaze fixed on the path ahead, her senses on high alert. The pre-Architect ruins were treacherous, the ground unstable, littered with sinkholes and razor-sharp debris.

*“Approaching the coordinates for the sealed sub-sector perimeter, Kaia,”* Ryn’s voice crackled through their headsets. *“According to Old World schematics, the primary containment wall should be directly ahead. It was constructed using ferrocrete slabs, likely several meters thick.”*

The crawler rounded a pile of rubble that had once been a transit station. Before them loomed a colossal, featureless wall, stretching as far as the eye could see in either direction, disappearing into the toxic haze. It was a sheer, unbroken cliff of dark, stained ferrocrete, bearing no markings, no gates, no indication of what lay beyond. It was the monolith of a forgotten quarantine.

“Well, that’s not subtle,” Felix muttered. “They really didn’t want anyone getting in. Or out.”

*“The work order for Sub-level Access Tunnel 7-C indicated it was an pre-existing service tunnel that was later sealed from the *outside* during the Epsilon clearance,”* Ryn relayed. *“Its original entry point should be on this side of the main containment wall, likely disguised or built over during the subsequent redevelopment. I’m cross-referencing geological surveys with utility maps to pinpoint its probable location. It won’t be obvious.”*

They disembarked, the crawler’s engine falling silent, leaving an unnerving quiet broken only by the drip of corrosive liquids from shattered overhead pipes and the distant howl of the wind through the canyons of ruined steel. The air here was acrid, burning their sinuses despite their suit filters.

Following Ryn’s guidance, they moved along the base of the immense wall, their boots crunching on glass-like shards of fused earth. The ground was littered with the detritus of a hasty, large-scale construction project – discarded tools, snapped power conduits, and rusted sections of what looked like massive sealing clamps.

*“My readings suggest the tunnel entrance is approximately fifty meters ahead, Kaia,”* Ryn’s voice directed. *“Look for signs of subsidence, or unusual patterns in the debris. It was likely backfilled, but not with the same solidity as the main wall.”*

Felix’s motion scanner suddenly beeped. “Movement. Multiple contacts. Small, fast. Not human.”
From the rubble piles and shattered building husks surrounding them, pale, multi-legged creatures with segmented bodies and snapping mandibles began to emerge, their forms disturbingly similar to oversized, irradiated insects.

“Rad-roaches, jumbo size,” Felix grunted, raising his pulse rifle. “Guess the welcoming committee is here too.”

“Conserve ammo,” Kaia ordered, firing a controlled burst that vaporized the lead creature. “We don’t know what’s waiting for us on the other side of that wall, or if we can even find a way in.”

They fought a brief, vicious skirmish, the creatures surprisingly resilient, their chitinous armor deflecting glancing shots. The air filled with the stench of their scorched ichor.

Once the immediate threat was neutralized, they resumed their search. Kaia spotted it first – a section of the ground near the base of the wall that seemed… newer. The debris was piled differently, the earth beneath it less compacted.

“Ryn, check this spot,” she said, sending him visual data.

*“…Confirmed, Kaia. Seismic resonance is different here. Consistent with a backfilled tunnel entrance. This should be it. Tunnel 7-C.”*

There was no obvious door, no hatch. Just a seemingly solid expanse of rubble and packed earth pressed against the ferrocrete wall.
“Time to make some noise after all,” Felix said, hefting a seismic charge. “How deep do you reckon this plug goes, Ryn?”

*“…The original tunnel was approximately three meters in diameter. The backfill… unknown. Proceed with caution. The structural integrity of this entire area is questionable.”*

Felix carefully placed two charges. “Clear back!”

They retreated a safe distance. The charges detonated with a muffled whump, sending a plume of dust and debris into the air. When it settled, a dark, circular opening was visible – a maw leading into the earth, right at the base of the towering containment wall. The air that wafted from it was cold, stagnant, and carried a faint, unidentifiable metallic tang.

“Tunnel 7-C, I presume,” Kaia said, her light probing the darkness within. It was a rough-hewn passage, clearly very old, its walls slick with moisture.

“After you,” Felix said, his pulse rifle ready. “Let’s see what kind of horrors they decided to bury alive in here.”

With Ryn and Mileo as their digital eyes and ears, Kaia and Felix stepped out of the toxic daylight of Neo-Citania’s ruins and into the waiting blackness of the Epsilon-7 access tunnel, taking their first steps into the dead zone.
