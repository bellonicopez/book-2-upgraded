# Chapter 63: Corridors of Corruption

---

**Log Entry: Enclave Command. Mission Time: 02:20:05. Date: 2025-05-30. User: bellonicopez (Enclave Archives via Ryn)**
*Trident assault team (Felix, Kora, Anya, Jax) is inside Station Zero. Last transmission confirmed successful entry. Maintaining comm silence from their end as per protocol. Nautilus holding support position outside Entry Point Alpha. All enclave resources on standby. The silence is… heavy.*

The interior of Station Zero was a labyrinth of decay and distorted reality. The air in the initial maintenance corridor was stale, heavy with the metallic tang of ozone and something else… a faint, sickly sweet odor that Kora associated with concentrated, corrupted Cascade energy. Emergency lights flickered sporadically, casting long, dancing shadows that played tricks on the eyes. The psychic pressure from Thorne was a constant, suffocating blanket, punctuated by sharp, targeted probes that Kora, with the aid of the steadily pulsing Resonance Keystone, worked tirelessly to deflect.

“Floor plans from the Archives are only partially matching up,” Felix murmured, his voice low in their comms, which Mileo had configured for close-range, encrypted transmission. He consulted a display on his wrist. “Decades of neglect, seismic shifts, and Thorne’s… redecorating… have taken their toll. We’re navigating by Ryn’s last internal scan from the drone, but expect surprises.”

They moved cautiously, Felix taking point, his pulse rifle sweeping every shadowed corner. Anya and Jax flanked Kora, their movements economical and precise, weapons ready. The silence was unnerving, broken only by the drip of unseen water, the creak of stressed metal, and the rhythmic hum of Kora’s Keystone.

The first surprise came in the form of the environment itself. A seemingly solid corridor dissolved into a shimmering, heat-hazed mirage as they approached, revealing a gaping chasm where the floor should have been.
“Localized reality distortion,” Kora breathed, her hand instinctively going to the Keystone. “Thorne’s influence is warping the very fabric of this place.”
She focused her will, her song a low thrum that resonated with the Keystone. Slowly, the shimmering lessened, the illusory chasm flickering and then solidifying back into a damaged but passable section of walkway.
“Impressive,” Jax muttered, his visor reflecting the dim light. “But how much of that can you do?”
“As much as I have to,” Kora replied, though a line of strain was already visible on her brow.

Further in, they encountered the native "fauna" – or what Thorne had made of it. Mutated creatures, unlike anything they had seen on the surface or even in the surrounding waters, skittered in the shadows. Some were multi-limbed, insectoid horrors that scurried along walls and ceilings, their chittering echoing eerily. Others were bloated, vaguely humanoid shapes that shambled from darkened alcoves, their skin translucent, revealing pulsing organs beneath.

Anya was the first to engage, her pulse rifle spitting controlled bursts that vaporized a scuttling horror lunging from a ventilation shaft. Jax followed suit, his heavier weapon punching through the gelatinous body of a shambler. The creatures, while grotesque, seemed driven more by corrupted instinct than intelligent malice, but their numbers and the confined spaces made them a constant threat.

Thorne’s psychic attacks continued, relentless and insidious. He tried to separate them, whispering doubts into Felix’s mind about the loyalty of his team, projecting images of Anya and Jax turning on him. He bombarded Kora with visions of her own failure, the Keystone cracking, her song silenced, the enclave falling to dissonance.

“He’s trying to break our cohesion,” Felix stated, his voice a low growl after a particularly vicious psychic assault that had momentarily made him see Kora as a monstrous, entity-controlled puppet. He shook his head violently. “Reality check: Kora, status?”
“Holding, Felix,” Kora responded, her voice tight. “Keystone is absorbing most of it, but he’s persistent. He’s angry that we’re inside his… his mind, in a way.”

They found a partially collapsed stairwell that Ryn’s drone scan had indicated led towards the deeper, central core of the arcology. The descent was treacherous, each step uncertain. The air grew colder, the sickly sweet smell of corrupted Cascade energy more potent. Here, the whispers intensified, no longer just general malice but tailored, intimate barbs. Jax heard his deceased father’s voice again, not accusing this time, but begging him to turn back, to save himself. Anya heard her lost brother, crying out in fear, seemingly just around the next corner.

“It’s not real, Anya,” Kora said gently, placing a hand on her arm as Anya hesitated, her gaze fixed on a darkened passage. “He’s using your love for your brother against you. Focus on what is real. Us. This mission.”
Anya nodded, her jaw tight, and turned away from the illusory sound.

As they reached what they believed was the level just above Thorne’s primary nexus chamber, they found their path blocked by a massive, pulsating membrane of organic, bioluminescent tissue – a living wall that throbbed with the entity’s dark energy. Veins of sickly light pulsed within it, and it emitted a low, guttural moan.

“Well, that’s new,” Felix said grimly, his rifle aimed at the obscene barrier. “Doesn’t look like it’s going to invite us in for tea.”

Kora stepped forward, the Resonance Keystone flaring. “This is a direct manifestation of his control. A psychic construct given physical form. Brute force might get us through, but it will drain our resources and alert him more directly to our exact position.” She closed her eyes, her hands outstretched towards the pulsating wall. “Let me try to… unmake it.”

She began to sing, not a song of gentle harmonization, but a focused, resonant frequency designed to disrupt the specific Cascade energies binding the organic wall together. The Keystone amplified her efforts, projecting a beam of pure, white light that struck the membrane. The living wall recoiled, its moans turning into shrieks of dissonant energy. Thorne’s psychic presence slammed against Kora with renewed fury, a desperate attempt to protect his inner sanctum.

The battle was silent but titanic, Kora’s will against the entity’s, her song of order against his symphony of corruption. The air crackled with unseen energies. Slowly, agonizingly, the pulsating membrane began to thin, to lose its cohesion. Cracks of pure light appeared across its surface.

With a final, piercing note from Kora, amplified by the Keystone into a shockwave of harmonizing power, the living wall dissolved, its constituent energies dissipating into harmless, glittering motes of light, leaving behind only a scorched section of corridor and the acrid smell of ozone.

Kora swayed, Jax catching her arm. “Easy there,” he said, his voice rough with concern. “That looked like it took a lot out of you.”
“I’m… alright,” Kora managed, taking a deep breath. “But he knows we’re at his doorstep now. The next room… that’s likely the antechamber to his nexus.”

Felix nodded, his gaze fixed on the archway beyond where the membrane had been. “No more surprises. From here on, we expect the worst Thorne can throw at us. Let’s finish this.”
